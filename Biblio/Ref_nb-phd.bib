   abstract = {The dielectric permittivity and loss of vapor-deposited amorphous solid water (ASW) have been measured for fixed frequencies of 1 and 10 kHz from 80 K to its crystallization temperature. Similar measurements have also been made on the cubic ice formed after the crystallization of ASW and the hexagonal ice formed on heating the cubic ice. The loss tangent shows a broad sub-T g relaxation peak centered at about 100 K and an approach towards a plateau value which appears as a shoulder. The peak is attributed to thermally activated rotation of H2O molecules with one or two dangling OH groups on the surface of the pores of the microporous sample, and the shoulder to localized motions within the network structure. Sintering of the samples on thermal cycling between 77 and ≈120 K in vacuo causes the broad peak to vanish. With increase in temperature, above Tg, the loss tangent shows the emergence of the expected α-relaxation peak of a liquid at T>Tg, whose completion is terminated by the onset of crystallization to cubic ice at about the same temperature for 1 kHz and for 10 kHz measurements. Thereafter, crystallization becomes slower, thus allowing further observation of the low-temperature part of the α-relaxation peak. The dielectric loss of amorphous solid water at 80 K is nearly 20 times that of the cubic ice formed on its crystallization after heating to 193 K, and nearly 3.5 times higher at Tg. The dielectric loss of the cubic ice formed on crystallization tends towards a plateau value prior to rapidly increasing with increase in temperature, an evidence for a low temperature relaxation which vanishes on conversion to hexagonal ice. This relaxation indicates a remnant topologically disordered structure of intergranular water and/or stacking faults in cubic ice. Samples sintered by thermal cycling in vacuo to ≈120 K crystallized in one step, whereas those without prior thermal cycling crystallized in two steps to cubic ice. Annealing of the ASW at 130 K completely removes the broad peak at ≈100 K and reduces the magnitude of the β-relaxation process. Partial crystallization of ASW completely removes the β-relaxation process, which indicates either preferential crystallization at the local regions of high mobility in the amorphous matrix or a change in the structure of the amorphous phase during crystallization. © 1991 American Institute of Physics.},

The heat of crystallization of the annealed ASW to cubic ice is-1.29 f 0.01 kJ mol-'. These values are similar to those previously reported for hyperquenched glassy water. This similarity and the changes of the X-ray diffractograms feature indicate that ASW anneals or relaxes during heating in vacuo to a structural state approaching that of hyperquenched glassy water. Therefore, its state can be thermodynamically continuous with that of water, but its H-bonded structure is not likely to be the same as that of water at ambient temperature.},

The spectra of Ice Ih, while similar in their main features to those reported by earlier workers, differ significantly in detail, probably largely because much of the previous work, particularly on D2O ice, has been done with partly vitreous ice. The usual interpretation of the bands in terms of the v1, v2, v3, and vR vibrations of isolated molecules is greatly oversimplified because intermolecular coupling is important. There are at least six (five infrared and one Raman) bands due to O-D stretching vibrations in the spectrum of D2O Ice I, but the detailed origin is unknown. The breadth of the O-H and O-D stretching bands of HDO in dilute solution in D2O and H2O is interpreted as indicating a disarrangement of the oxygen positions due to the disorder of the hydrogen atoms.},

It is believed that pristine water is formed and grows on the surface of icy dust grains in dark interstellar clouds. Until now, there has been no experimental evidence whether this scenario is feasible or not on an astrophysically relevant template and by hydrogen and oxygen atom reactions. Aims. We present here the first experimental evidence of water synthesis by such a process on a realistic analogue of grain surface in dense clouds, i.e., amorphous water ice. Methods. Atomic beams of oxygen and deuterium are aimed at a porous water ice substrate (H2O) held at 10 K. Products are analyzed by the temperature-programmed desorption technique. Results. We observe the production of HDO and D2O, indicating that water is formed under conditions of the dense interstellar medium from hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

From CH 4 isothermal adsorption experiments at 40 K, surface areas of 280 ± 30 m 2 g -1 for the ASW deposits and of 40 ± 12 m 2 g -1 for comparable HGW samples were obtained. The crystallization kinetics was studied at 150 K by following the evolution of the band shape of the OD stretching vibration in HDO doped ASW and HGW samples generated at 14 K, 40 K and 90 K. Comparable rate constants of ∼7 × 10 -4 s -1 were obtained in all cases. However a significant difference was found between the n Avrami parameter of the samples generated at 14 K (n ∼ 1) and that of the rest (n > 2).

Phys. 138, 104502 (2013)10.1063/1.4793312), we investigate the mechanisms for the release of trapped gases from underneath amorphous solid water (ASW) films. In prior work, we reported the episodic release of trapped gases in concert with the crystallization of ASW, a phenomenon that we termed the molecular volcano. The observed abrupt desorption is due to the formation of cracks that span the film to form a connected pathway for release. In this paper, we utilize the molecular volcano desorption peak to characterize the formation of crystallization-induced cracks. We find that the crack length distribution is independent of the trapped gas (Ar, Kr, Xe, CH4, N2, O2, or CO). Selective placement of the inert gas layer is used to show that cracks form near the top of the film and propagate downward into the film. Isothermal experiments reveal that, after some induction time, cracks propagate linearly in time with an Arrhenius dependent velocity corresponding to an activation energy of 54 kJmol. This value is consistent with the crystallization growth rates reported by others and establishes a direct connection between crystallization growth rate and the crack propagation rate. A two-step model in which nucleation and crystallization occurs in an induction zone near the top of the film followed by the propagation of a crystallizationcrack front into the film is in good agreement with the temperature programmed desorption results. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

Their low temperatures (<10 K) allow the formation of thick icy dust mantles, which will be partially preserved in future protoplanetary disks, ultimately affecting the chemical composition of planetary systems. Previous observations have shown that carbon- and oxygen-bearing species, in particular CO, are heavily depleted in prestellar cores due to the efficient molecular freeze-out onto the surface of cold dust grains. However, N-bearing species such as NH 3 and, in particular, its deuterated isotopologues appear to maintain high abundances where CO molecules are mainly in the solid phase. Thanks to ALMA, we present here the first clear observational evidence of NH 2 D freeze-out toward the L1544 prestellar core, suggestive of the presence of a “complete depletion zone” within a ≃1800 au radius, in agreement with astrochemical prestellar core model predictions. Our state-of-the-art chemical model coupled with a non-LTE radiative transfer code demonstrates that NH 2 D becomes mainly incorporated in icy mantles in the central 2000 au and starts freezing out already at ≃7000 au. Radiative transfer effects within the prestellar core cause the NH 2 D(1 11 − 1 01 ) emission to appear centrally concentrated, with a flattened distribution within the central ≃3000 au, unlike the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission, which shows a clear peak within the central ≃1800 au. This prevented NH 2 D freeze-out from being detected in previous observations, where the central 1000 au cannot be spatially resolved. },

These small bodies in cold regions of the disks are typically considered as mixtures of dust particles with molecular ices, where ices cover the surface of a dust core or are actually physically mixed with dust. Whilst the first case, ice-on-dust, has been intensively studied in the laboratory in recent decades, the second case, ice-mixed-with-dust, present uncharted territory. This work is the first laboratory study of the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of water ice mixed with amorphous carbon and silicate grains. We show that the kinetics of desorption of H2O ice depends strongly on the dust/ice mass ratio, probably, due to the desorption of water molecules from a large surface of fractal clusters composed of carbon or silicate grains. In addition, it is shown that water ice molecules are differently bound to silicate grains in contrast to carbon. The results provide a link between the structure and morphology of small cosmic bodies and the kinetics of desorption of water ice included in them.},

Radiative transfer models for clouds can also be applied to snow; the important differences in their radiative properties are that clouds are optically thinner and contain smaller ice crystals than snow. Absorption of visible and near-ultraviolet radiation by ice is so weak that absorption of sunlight at these wavelengths in natural snow is dominated by trace amounts of light-absorbing impurities such as dust and soot. In the thermal infrared, ice is moderately absorptive, so snow is nearly a blackbody, with emissivity 98-99%. The absorption spectrum of liquid water resembles that of ice from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared. At longer wavelengths they diverge, so microwave emission can be used to detect snowmelt on ice sheets, and to discriminate between sea ice and open water, by remote sensing. Snow and ice are transparent to radio waves, so radar can be used to infer ice-sheet thickness.

For almost 120 years, it has been a stomping ground for scientific discovery, and ice research has often been a trailblazer for investigations into a wide range of materials-related phenomena. Here, the experimental progress of the last couple of years is reviewed, and open questions as well as future challenges are discussed. The specific topics include (i) the polytypism and stacking disorder of ice I, (ii) the mechanism of the pressure amorphization of ice I, (iii) the emptying of gas-filled clathrate hydrates to give new low-density ice polymorphs, (iv) the effects of acid/base doping on hydrogen-ordering phase transitions as well as (v) the formation of solid solutions between salts and the ice polymorphs, and the effect this has on the appearance of the phase diagram. In addition to continuing efforts to push the boundaries in terms of the extremes of pressure and temperature, the exploration of the "chemical" dimensions of ice research appears to now be a newly emerging trend. It is without question that ice research has entered a very exciting era.},

We here introduce these amorphous ices and discuss the question of how many of these forms are of relevance in the context of polyamorphism. We employ the criterion of reversible transitions between amorphous "states" in finite intervals of pressure and temperature to discriminate between independent metastable amorphous "states" and between "substates" of the same amorphous "state". We argue that the experimental evidence suggests we should consider there to be three polyamorphic "states" of ice, namely low-(LDA), high-(HDA) and very high-density amorphous ice (VHDA). In addition to the realization of reversible transitions between them, they differ in terms of their properties, e.g., compressibility, or number of "interstitial" water molecules. Thus they cannot be regarded as structurally relaxed variants of each other and so we suggest considering them as three distinct megabasins in an energy landscape visualization. © 2011 the Owner Societies.},

Although the global structure of this material, i.e. the bulk and the surface, is well characterised, we are far from having an overall understanding of the changes induced upon chemical or physical perturbation. More specifically, the behaviour of the surface and the immediate sublayers upon mid-infrared irradiation must be understood due to its direct effect on the adsorption capacities of the ASW surface. Small molecules can accrete or form at the surface, adsorbed on the dangling OH groups of surface water molecules. This behaviour allows further reactivity which, in turn, could lead to more complex molecular systems. We have already demonstrated that selective IR irradiations of surface water molecules induce a modification of the surface and the production of a new monomer species which bonds to the surface via its two electronic doublets. However, we did not probe the structure of the dangling bands, namely their homogeneity or inhomogeneity. The structure and orientation of these surface molecules are closely linked to the way the surface can relax its vibrational energy. In this work, we have focussed our attention on the two dH dangling bonds, carrying out a series of selective irradiations which reveal the inhomogeneity of these surface modes. We have also studied the effects of irradiation duration on the surface reorientation, determining that the maximum photoinduced isomerisation yield is ∼15%. This journal is},

   abstract = {Amorphous solid water (ASW) is one of the most widely studied molecular systems. Ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) and potentially present in the upper layers of the Earths atmosphere, ASW plays a major role in heterogeneous physical chemistry. Small molecules form or accrete at the ice surface, bonding to water molecules with an OH bond projecting from the surface, so-called dangling bonds. These dangling OH are of crucial importance in the quest to identify and quantify surface reactions. Water ices in the ISM or Earths atmosphere undergo constant processing by thermal and irradiation effects, which can significantly affect both the bulk and surface structures and therefore the catalytic properties of the surface. In this work we have studied thermal and irradiation processing of ASW and determine that there is a photochemical processing pathway of the ice surface which is clearly distinct from purely thermal effects. Selective IR irradiations of each of the surface water modes led to the observation of a hole-burning at the irradiation frequency, counterbalanced by the production of a new band, identified as a water monomer interacting with the surface. The thermal effects, meanwhile, led to a global decrease of all the dangling modes due to global reorganization of the water ice structure. It is thus obvious that, depending on the processing history of an ice, its catalytic properties will not be affected in the same way. The fact that we observe an IR selective irradiation effect illustrates that some fraction of the vibrational energy, rather than being relaxed through the H-bonded network of the bulk ice, is trapped at the surface; this energy induces a reorganization of the surface structure, forming new trapping sites, and thus generating new catalytic properties.},

Indeed, ASW is ubiquitous in the cold interstellar medium (ISM), where ASW-coated dust grains provide a catalytic surface for solid phase chemistry, and is believed to be present in the Earth's atmosphere at high altitudes. It has been shown that the ice surface adsorbs small molecules such as CO, N 2, or CH4, most likely at OH groups dangling from the surface. Our study presents completely new insights concerning the behavior of ASW upon selective infrared (IR) irradiation of its dangling modes. When irradiated, these surface H2O molecules reorganize, predominantly forming a stabilized monomer-like water mode on the ice surface. We show that we systematically provoke "hole-burning" effects (or net loss of oscillators) at the wavelength of irradiation and reproduce the same absorbed water monomer on the ASW surface. Our study suggests that all dangling modes share one common channel of vibrational relaxation; the ice remains amorphous but with a reduced range of binding sites, and thus an altered catalytic capacity. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Amorphous solid water (ASW) is abundantly present in the interstellar medium where it forms a mantle on interstellar dust particles and it is the precursor for cometary ices. In space, ASW acts as a substrate for interstellar surface chemistry leading to complex molecules and it is postulated to play a critical role in proton-transfer reactions. Although ASW is widely studied and is generally well characterized by different techniques, energetically induced structural changes, such as ion, electron, and photon irradiation, in these materials are less well understood. Selective pumping of specific infrared (IR) vibrational modes can aid in understanding the role of vibrations in restructuring of hydrogen-bonding networks. Here, we present the first experimental results on hydrogen-bonding changes in ASW induced by the intense, nearly monochromatic mid-IR free-electron laser (FEL) radiation of the FELIX-2 beamline at the FELIX Laboratory at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The changes are monitored by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy. Upon resonant irradiation, a modification in the IR absorption band profile of ASW is observed in agreement with a growing crystalline-like contribution and a decreasing amorphous contribution. This phenomenon saturates within a few minutes of FEL irradiation, modifying upward of 94% of the irradiated ice. The effect is further analyzed in terms of hydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, and the experiments are complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to constrain the effect at the molecular level.},

   abstract = {Context. H2O is the most abundant component of astrophysical ices. In most lines of sight it is not possible to fit both the H2O 3 μm stretching, the 6 μm bending intensities with a single pure H 2O spectrum. Recent Spitzer observations have revealed CO2 ice in high abundances and it has been suggested that CO2 mixed into H2O ice can affect the positions, shapes and relative strengths of the 3 μm and 6 μm bands. Aims. We investigate whether the discrepancy in intensity between H2O bands in interstellar clouds and star forming regions can be explained by CO2 mixed into the observed H 2O ice affecting the bands differently. Methods. Laboratory infrared transmission spectroscopy is used to record spectra of H2O:CO 2 ice mixtures at astrophysically relevant temperatures and composition ratios. Results. The H2O peak profiles and band strengths are significantly different in H2O:CO2 ice mixtures compared to pure H2O ice. The ratio between the strengths of the 3 μm and 6 μm bands drops linearly with CO2 concentration such that it is 50% lower in a 1:1 mixture compared to pure H2O ice. In all H2O:CO2 mixtures, a strong free-OH stretching band appears around 2.73 μm, which can be used to put an upper limit on the CO2 concentration in the H2O ice. The H2O bending mode profile also changes drastically with CO2 concentration; the broad pure H2O band gives way to two narrow bands as the CO 2 concentration is increased. This makes it crucial to constrain the environment of H2O ice to enable correct assignments of other species contributing to the interstellar 6 μm absorption band. The amount of CO 2 present in the H2O ice of B5:IRS 1 is estimated by simultaneously comparing the H2O stretching and bending regions and the CO2 bending mode to laboratory spectra of H2O, CO 2, H2O:CO2 and HCOOH. © ESO 2007.},

Amorphous ice is crystallized by heating, while crystalline ice is amorphized through disruption by particle radiation. We determine ice lattice order using infrared spectra from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on the Galileo Jupiter orbiter. The shape of the reflectance peak near 3.1 μm is diagnostic of the lattice order in the top micrometers of the surface. A narrow, temperature-sensitive band near 1.65 μm, from ∼1 mm depth, is missing for amorphous ice. Spectral averages of >100 pixels were used for Europa and Callisto, because of high radiation noise and small ice amounts, respectively. Model comparisons show that the surface ice is predominantly amorphous on Europa and predominantly crystalline on Callisto, while both types of ice are found on Ganymede. The distribution of Ganymede ice properties shows a broad global pattern of more amorphous ice in the high-latitude Jovian-facing hemisphere and in the low-latitude trailing hemisphere. The ice at ∼1 mm depth on all three satellites is predominantly crystalline. The radiation flux increases by ∼300 times between Callisto and Europa, while the thermal crystallization rate may vary over five orders of magnitude among the three satellites (being the fastest at Callisto). The occurrence of crystalline and amorphous ice suggests a balance between the disruption and crystallization, with Callisto dominated by thermal crystallization and Europa by radiative disruption, and with nearly equal rates between the two processes at Ganymede.

However, Maisch's observation of the constancy of the depolarization ratio across each of the bands in the hydrogen stretching region is a strong argument for a disordered structure. Satisfactory assignments have only been made for the three bands originating in the fundamental modes of the water molecule and for the six strong bands which can be correlated with the overtone and combination modes of the liquid and vapour spectra. An explicit characterization of the low frequency bands in terms of lattice motions must await a solution to the lattice-dynamical problem as well as a careful study of the low frequency, polarized spectra of single crystals.

The sample is complemented with previously published Spitzer spectra of background stars and with ISO spectra of well-studied massive YSOs (L $ 10 5 L). The long-known 6.0 and 6.85 m bands are detected toward all sources, with the Class 0Y type YSOs showing the deepest bands ever observed. The 6.0 m band is often deeper than expected from the bending mode of pure solid H 2 O. The additional 5Y7 m absorption consists of five independent components, which, by comparison to laboratory studies, must be from at least eight different carriers. Much of this absorption is due to simple species likely formed by grain surface chemistry, at abundances of 1%Y30% for CH 3 OH, 3%Y8% for NH 3 , 1%Y5% for HCOOH, $6% for H 2 CO, and $0.3% for HCOO À relative to solid H 2 O. The 6.85 m band has one or two carriers, of which one may be less volatile than H 2 O. Its carrier(s) formed early in the molecular cloud evolution and do not survive in the diffuse ISM. If an NH þ 4-containing salt is the carrier, its abundance relative to solid H 2 O is $7%, demonstrating the efficiency of low-temperature acid-base chemistry or cosmic-rayYinduced reactions. Possible origins are discussed for enigmatic, very broad absorption between 5 and 8 m. Finally, the same ices are observed toward massive and low-mass YSOs, indicating that processing by internal UV radiation fields is a minor factor in their early chemical evolution.},

Measurements of column densities and molecular abundances relative to water require the knowledge of infrared band strengths. We present a review of refractive indices at visible wavelengths, densities and infrared band strengths for all eight molecules. We also present new band strengths measured on icy films whose thicknesses have been determined using laser interference techniques. For CO2, CO, CH4 and NH3, our measurements are in agreement with previous determinations taking into account an uncertainty of about 20 per cent. For H2O ice films, the porosity and the density remain unreliable, leading to large uncertainties on the measured band strengths. Concerning amorphous CH3OH, H2CO and HCOOH, the densities and refractive indices are unknown leading to large uncertainties on the band strengths. However, we propose new values that are slightly different from previous determination. Our review and experimental work point out the most reliable band strengths for the eight studied molecules. For CH4, CH3OH, HCOOH and H2CO, the band strengths used to calculate abundances in the ices of interstellar medium seem to be inaccurate, leading to some doubts on the determined values.},

   abstract = {An ability to prepare clathrate hydrates using low temperature-high vacuum techniques, originally demonstrated for the hydrate of oxirane (Bertie and Devlin), has been extended to include the structure I hydrate of H2S, the mixed structure I hydrate of oxirane and ethane, as well as the structure II simple hydrate of THF and the double hydrates of THF with oxirane and H 2S. The crystalline clathrate films (∼6 μ) have been formed either by annealing amorphous host-guest deposits at ∼130 K, epitaxial growth at 110 K (oxirane and mixed ethane-oxirane), or direct deposition at 150 K (THF and its double clathrates). Use of the epitaxial approach at ∼100 K has permitted the formation of the oxirane clathrate hydrate containing intact isolated D2O molecules. This has permitted the FT-IR observation of the ν3-ν1 doublet in the O-D stretching region (2455 and 2380 cm-1 at 100 K) with the values, after correction for Fermi resonance, suggesting a splitting from intramolecular coupling of ∼56 cm-1 (2455 vs 2399 cm-1), which compares closely with the 52 cm-1 deduced for cubic ice. Spectra for the structure I hydrates of oxirane and H2S contain absorption bands produced by guest molecules confined to both small and large clathrate cages. Use of the structure II double hydrates has permitted the firm identification of the structure I infrared bands with oxirane and H2S molecules in cages of one size or the other. Thus, the weaker ν3 and (ν11, ν14) bands of oxirane at 1281 and 1152 cm-1 have been assigned to molecules in the small cages since only these oxirane features remain in the structure II double hydrate with THF. In this case the smaller oxirane molecules occupy the small cages while the THF molecules enter the larger cages, exclusively. In a similar manner, the H-S stretching vibrations of H2S in the structure I small cages have been assigned to a band complex near 2610 cm-1, some 50 cm-1 above the band system for H2S in the large structure I clathrate cages. Such a result suggests that the net H2S perturbation, relative to the gas phase, is greater for the large than for the small cages and may be interpreted as evidence for a "double well" large cage potential or as further evidence that the cage model of Pimentel and Charles for guest-molecule stretching modes is valid. © 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

Our best insight into their chemistry is currently provided by carbonaceous chondritic meteorites, but the meteorite record is biased: only the strongest types survive atmospheric entry and are then modified by interaction with the terrestrial environment. Here we present the results of a detailed bulk and microanalytical study of pristine Ryugu particles, brought to Earth by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. Ryugu particles display a close compositional match with the chemically unfractionated, but aqueously altered, CI (Ivuna-type) chondrites, which are widely used as a proxy for the bulk Solar System composition. The sample shows an intricate spatial relationship between aliphatic-rich organics and phyllosilicates and indicates maximum temperatures of ~30 °C during aqueous alteration. We find that heavy hydrogen and nitrogen abundances are consistent with an outer Solar System origin. Ryugu particles are the most uncontaminated and unfractionated extraterrestrial materials studied so far, and provide the best available match to the bulk Solar System composition.},

Since then, over a hundred different water models have been proposed. Despite being widely studied, water remains poorly understood. Examining the evolution of water models, we identified three distinct philosophies in water modelling, namely the employment of effective point charges in pioneering empirical models, the incorporation of polarization to describe many-body inductive effects and the extensive use of ab initio calculations to describe short-range effects. In doing so, we can appraise the current understanding of water and identify attributes that a water model should possess to capture the intricate interactions between water molecules.},

The aim of the present study is to compare the mid-infrared spectra of laboratory silicate grain/water ice mixtures with astronomical observations to evaluate the presence of dust/ice mixtures in interstellar and circumstellar environments. The laboratory data can explain the observations, assuming reasonable mass-averaged temperatures for the protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, demonstrating that a substantial fraction of water ice may be mixed with silicate grains. On the basis of the combination of laboratory data and infrared observations, we provide evidence of the presence of solid-state water in the diffuse interstellar medium. Our results have implications for future laboratory studies investigating cosmic dust grain analogues and for future observations trying to identify the structure, composition and temperature of grains in different astrophysical environments.},

   abstract = {<p>The desorption properties of H2O films are investigated across a wide range of film thicknesses from 53 nanometres (nm) to 101 micrometres (μm) using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) and temperature-programmed desorption. Three desorption stages are observed belonging to amorphous solid water (ASW), stacking disordered ice I (ice Isd), and hexagonal ice I (ice Ih). The desorption of ASW is only detectable for the ≥10 μm films and is separated from the ice I desorption by 10–15 K with an associated desorption energy of ∼64 kJ mol−1. The desorption energy of the 53-nm film was found to be near 50 kJ mol−1 as also noted in the literature, but with increasing film thickness, the desorption energy of ice I rises, reaching a plateau around 65–70 kJ mol−1. The reason for the increased desorption energy is suggested to be due to molecules unable to desorb due to the thick covering layer of H2O and possibly re-adsorption events. Before complete desorption of ice I at around 220 K for the 101 μm film, a two-stage ice I desorption is observed with the QCM for the ≥10 μm films near 200 K. This event corresponds to the desorption of ice Isd as corroborated by X-ray diffraction patterns collected upon heating from 92 to 260 K at ambient pressure. Cubic ice is not observed as is commonly stated in the literature as resulting from the crystallization of ASW. Therefore, ice Isd is the correct terminology for the initial crystallization product of ASW.</p>},

This study measures the ODSB/OHSB for isotopically substituted D2O/H2O (with volume ratio VD2O/VH2O of 1/0, 4/1, 1/1, 1/4 and 0/1) ice Ih, and compares them with those for liquid water and ices in various phases. The data show that istopic substitution (IS) narrows the ODSB/OHSB of ice from both the low-frequency and the high-frequency side to the middle of the OD/OH stretch regions, but in contrast, IS enhances the high-frequency part of the ODSB/OHSB for liquid water. The ODSB/OHSB features of ice and their dependences on IS and phase transition can be understood basically from the concept that ice has diverse HB configurations that depend on the ice lattice form and the proton (dis)order and essentially determine the intermolecular vibrational couplings in ice. Combined with a Gaussian fitting analysis, more details for the HB configurations in ice are revealed: tetrahedral HB profiles, which are responsible for the main peak, are dominant and non-tetrahedral ones, which bring about the high-frequency shoulders, are also important. On IS, the proportion of tetrahedral HB profiles sees a dramatic decrease.},

   abstract = {It is considered that hydrophobic solutes dissolve in water via the formation of icelike cages in the first hydration shell. However, this conventional picture is currently under debate. We have investigated how hydrophobic species, such as D2, Ne, Ar, Xe, CH4, and C3H8, interact with water in composite films of amorphous solid water (ASW) based on temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The D2 and Ne species tend to be incorporated in ASW without being caged, whereas two distinct peaks assignable to the caged species are identifiable for the other solutes examined here. The low-temperature peak is observed preferentially for Ar and CH4 prior to crystallization. The hydrophobes are thought to be encapsulated in porous ASW films via reorganization of the hydrogen bond network up to 100 K; most of them are released in a liquidlike phase that occurs immediately before crystallization at ca. 160 K. The nature of hydrophobic hydration at cryogenic temperature appears to differ from that in normal water at room temperature because the former resembles crystalline ices in the local hydrogen-bond structure rather than the latter. No ordered structures assignable to clathrate hydrates were identified before and after crystallization.},

The measured lines come from one-photon spectra recorded at room temperature in absorption, from hot samples with temperatures up to 3000K recorded in emission, and from multiresonance excitation spectra which sample levels up to dissociation.

This article presents energy levels and line positions of the following singly deuterated isotopologues of water: HD16O, HD17O, and HD18O. The MARVEL (measured active rotational-vibrational energy levels) procedure is used to determine the levels, the lines, and their self-consistent uncertainties for the spectral regions 0-22708, 0-1674, and 0-12105cm-1 for HD16O, HD17O, and HD18O, respectively. For HD16O, 54740 transitions were analyzed from 76 sources, the lines come from spectra recorded both at room temperature and from hot samples. These lines correspond to 36690 distinct assignments and 8818 energy levels. For HD17O, only 485 transitions could be analyzed from three sources; the lines correspond to 162 MARVEL energy levels. For HD18O, 8729 transitions were analyzed from 11 sources and these lines correspond to 1864 energy levels. The energy levels are checked against ones determined from accurate variational nuclear motion computations employing exact kinetic energy operators. This comparison shows that the measured transitions account for about 86% of the anticipated absorbance of HD16O at 296K and that the transitions predicted by the MARVEL energy levels account for essentially all the remaining absorbance. The extensive list of MARVEL lines and levels obtained are given in the Supplementary Material of this article, as well as in a distributed information system applied to water, W@DIS, where they can easily be retrieved. In addition, the transition and energy level information for H217O and H218O, given in the first paper of this series [Tennyson, et al. J Quant Spectr Rad Transfer 2009;110:573-96], has been updated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Th The amplitude, the temperature dependence, and the physical origin of the water vapour absorption continuum are a long-standing issue in molecular spectroscopy with direct impact in atmospheric and planetary sciences. In recent years, we have determined the self-continuum absorption of water vapour at different spectral points of the atmospheric windows at 4.0, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.25 μm, by highly sensitive cavity-enhanced laser techniques. These accurate experimental constraints have been used to adjust the last version (3.2) of the semi-empirical MT-CKD model (Mlawer-Tobin-Clough-Kneizys-Davies), which is widely incorporated in atmospheric radiative-transfer codes. In the present work, the self-continuum cross-sections, CS, are newly determined at 3.3 μm (3007 cm-1) and 2.0 μm (5000 cm-1) by optical-feedback-cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OFCEAS) and cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), respectively. These new data allow extending the spectral coverage of the 4.0 and 2.1 μm windows, respectively, and testing the recently released 3.2 version of the MT-CKD continuum. By considering high temperature literature data together with our data, the temperature dependence of the selfcontinuum is also obtained.},

   abstract = {Infrared spectra of the water clusters have been measured in the N 2 + O2 matrix. The aggregation process of water in the matrix has been monitored by annealing the deposited samples up to 40 K and UV irradiation. The monomer, dimer, cyclic trimer and cyclic pentamer are found as water clusters in the matrix. For the hexamer, several structures such as chair, cage, prism, bag 1 and/or book 1 are likely to exist. By UV irradiation, the cyclic pentamer is predominantly formed from the monomer and dimer. On the other hand, by annealing the deposited sample, several hexamers are formed. The theoretical calculation for water clusters has revealed that the formation of one hydrogen bonding in a hydrogen-bonded chain cooperatively enhances or diminishes the strength of another hydrogen bond. Both proton donor (D) and acceptor (A) participating in a hydrogen-bonding pair DA are capable of forming hydrogen bonding with the other water molecules; D can additionally accept two protons and donate one proton, and A can additionally donate two protons and accept one proton. We have proposed the classification of hydrogen-bonding patterns considering the cooperativity, denoting as d′a′DAd″ a″, where d and a are integers indicating the number of proton donors and acceptors to D (the single prime) and A (the double prime), respectively. Then, a magnitude given by MOH = -d′ + a′ + d″ -a″ has been introduced, which is very useful for connecting the hydrogen-bonding patterns to their OH wavenumbers. As a result, it is revealed that the OH stretching bands of water clusters are characterized by eight indicators (free and MOH = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). The classification proposed here is applicable to the OH band analysis for the hydrogen-bonded water and alcohols in a condensed phase. © The Owner Societies 2005.},

In this work we present a complementary analysis in the time-domain, by decomposing the appropriate response functions into diagonal and off-diagonal contributions (in the local mode basis). Our analysis indicates that all vibrational spectra show signatures of coherent vibrational energy transfer.

Phys. Chem. A 2002, 106, 11993]. It is found that the relation between the OH stretch frequency and the length of the hydrogen bond in which the OH is involved is characterized by considerable dispersion. This dispersion, which is in part related to the varying OHO angle of the hydrogen bond, precludes a one-to-one correspondence between the OH frequency and the hydrogen bond length. Further, it is found that the time scale currently interpreted in terms of a stochastic modulation by the surrounding solvent of a highly frictionally damped hydrogen bond system is largely governed by hydrogen bond-breaking and -making dynamics, while the motion of an intact hydrogen-bonded complex is underdamped in character. A detailed analysis of these issues is provided for calculated spectral dynamics after creation of a hole in the ground vibrational state, in terms of a three time analysis (in addition to the H-bond period). Further, the validity of describing the OH frequency fluctuations as a Gaussian random process is examined, as is the character of the associated autocorrelation function of the OH frequency shift.},

   abstract = {The theoretical study of off-resonant fifth-order two-dimensional (2D)-Raman spectroscopy is made to analyze the intermolecular dynamics of liquid and solid water. The 2D-Raman spectroscopy is susceptible to the nonlinear anharmonic dynamics and local hydrogen bond structure in water. It is found that the distinct 2D-Raman response appears as the negative signal near the t 2 axis. The origin of this negative signal for t2< 15 fs is from the nonlinear polarizability in the librational motions, whereas that for 30 fs< t2 < 150 fs is attributed to the anharmonic translational motions. It is found that the mechanical anharmonicity and nonlinear polarizability couplings among modes clearly can be observed as the sum- and difference-frequency peaks in the 2D-Raman spectrum (i.e., Fourier transforms of the response). The 2D-Raman spectroscopies of ice Ih and amorphous ices, i.e., low density, high density, and very high density amorphous ices, are also investigated. It is found that the 2D-Raman spectroscopy is very sensitive to the anisotropy of the structure of ice Ih. The strong hydrogen bond stretching band is seen in the 2D-Raman spectroscopy of the polarization directions parallel to the c axis, whereas the contributions of the librational motion can be also seen in the spectrum with the polarization directions parallel to the a axis. The 2D-Raman spectroscopy is also found to be also very sensitive to the differences in local hydrogen bond network structures in various amorphous phases. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {A new model is proposed for liquid water, based on recent studies of the Raman spectra as a function of temperature. It features two kinds of hydrogen bonds: in addition to the well known linear hydrogen bonds (LHB), predominant in cold water, there are some bifurcated hydrogen bonds (BHB) between three water molecules. These three-centered bonds, mainly electrostatic, have an average energy of 2.5 kcal mol-', about half of that of the LHB. Their characteristic 0-H stretching frequency is around 3420-3440 cm-', compared with 3220 cm-' for the LHB. In addition, there are a few percent of nearly free OH groups, i.e. non-hydrogen-bonded (NHB), with a stretching frequency of ca 3615 cm-'. Reorientation between these three states occurs through rotation of the H20 molecules about one of their 0-H bonds. Thus, on melting, one third of the hydrogen atoms move out of the tetrahedral framework to occupy interstitial sites in the open 'shafts' characteristic of the ice structure. As in the case of ice, Fermi resonance between the v1 and 2v, levels has little impact on the vibrational spectra of liquid water and ice. The hybrid molecule, HDO, does not form LHB with H 2 0 or D20, hence its simpler spectra. The BHB model can account much better than previous models for the thermodynamic anomalies of water.},

The continuum baseline correction made prior to analysing ice profiles influences the subsequent analysis and hence the estimated ice composition, typically obtained by band fitting using thin film ice mixture spectra. We model the effect of grain growth on ice mantle spectroscopic profiles, focusing on CO2 to see how it can affect interstellar ice mantle spectral analysis and interpretation. Using the Discrete Dipole Approximation for Scattering and Absorption of Light, the mass absorption coefficients of distributions of grains composed of ellipsoidal silicate cores with water and carbon dioxide ice mantles are calculated. A few other ice mantle compositions are also calculated. We explore the size distribution evolution from dense clouds to simulate the first steps of grain growth up to three microns in size. The results are injected into RADMC-3D full scattering radiative transfer models of spherical clouds and protoplanetary disk templates to retrieve observable spectral energy distributions. We focus on calculated profile of the CO2 antisymmetric stretching mode ice band profile at 4.27 microns, a meaningful indicator of grain growth. The observed profiles toward dense cores with the Infrared space observatory and Akari satellites already showed profiles possibly indicative of moderate grain growth.The observation of protoplanetary disks at high inclination with the JWST should present distorted profiles that will put constraints on the extent of dust growth. The more evolved the dust size distribution, the more the extraction of the ice mantle composition will require both understanding and taking into account grain growth.},

To date, the most complex solid-phase molecule detected with certainty in the interstellar medium is methanol, but the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may be able to identify still larger organic species. In this study, we use a coupled chemodynamical model to predict new candidate species for JWST detection toward the young star-forming core Cha-MMS1, combining the gas–grain chemical kinetic code MAGICKAL with a 1D radiative hydrodynamics simulation using Athena++ . With this model, the relative abundances of the main ice constituents with respect to water toward the core center match well with typical observational values, providing a firm basis to explore the ice chemistry. Six oxygen-bearing COMs (ethanol, dimethyl ether, acetaldehyde, methyl formate, methoxy methanol, and acetic acid), as well as formic acid, show abundances as high as, or exceeding, 0.01% with respect to water ice. Based on the modeled ice composition, the infrared spectrum is synthesized to diagnose the detectability of the new ice species. The contribution of COMs to IR absorption bands is minor compared to the main ice constituents, and the identification of COM ice toward the core center of Cha-MMS1 with the JWST NIRCAM/Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (2.4–5.0 μ m) may be unlikely. However, MIRI observations (5–28 μ m) toward COM-rich environments where solid-phase COM abundances exceed 1% with respect to the column density of water ice might reveal the distinctive ice features of COMs. },

   abstract = {The crystallization kinetics of thin, dense amorphous solid water films deposited on crystalline ice and Pt(111) substrates are investigated. A dramatic acceleration of the crystallization rate is observed for amorphous films on crystalline ice substrates. The acceleration originates from the absence of the nucleation process on the crystalline ice substrate which serves as a two-dimensional nucleus for the growth of the crystalline phase. This contrasts with the crystallization on a Pt(111) substrate which proceeds via bulk nucleation and three-dimensional growth. Activation energies for growth and nucleation are determined to be 56 and 140 kJ/mol, respectively, using the apparent activation energies measured on crystalline ice and Pt(111) substrates. For amorphous films deposited on crystalline ice substrates, the crystallization rate decreases rapidly with increasing distance from the crystalline ice substrate most probably due to crystallization-induced cracking of the films. © 2000 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {X-ray diffraction data show that there are at least two forms of amorphous solid water which differ in density and second nearest-neighbor oxygen-oxygen distribution. (a) The lower density form, made at 77°K, has a diffraction pattern consistent with a structure that has oxygen-oxygen nearest-neighbor tetrahedral symmetry on average, and a nearest neighbor O-O separation of 2.76 Å with small dispersion. The density of this material is estimated to be 0.94 g cm-3. While it is not possible to uniquely define the structure, the data available support the notion that its fundamental characteristic is the existence of a randomized network of hydrogen bonds with O-O-O angular distribution derived from (i.e., centered about) that of ice Ih. Comparison of neutron diffraction and x-ray diffraction data suggests strongly that the first shell hydrogen bonds are nearly linear and that orientational correlations between water molecules are limited to nearest neighbors. (b) The higher density form, made at 10°K, has a diffraction pattern similar to, yet distinctively different from, that of the high temperature deposit. The O-O nearest neighbor distance is the same, 2.76 Å, but the dispersion in this separation is larger in the low temperature form. The diffraction pattern shows an extra peak at 3.3 Å, corresponding to about 1.4 molecules, the existence of which is responsible for the estimated higher density, namely 1.1 g cm-3. The data are consistent with several models which share the feature of introducing small O-O-O angles into the structure. We discuss the relationships between our data, and inferences from the data, and the corresponding data for liquid water. Copyright © 1976 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Partial condensation of dust from the Solar nebula is likely responsible for the diverse chemical compositions of chondrites and rocky planets/planetesimals in the inner Solar system. We present a forward physical-chemical model of a protoplanetary disc to predict the chemical compositions of planetary building blocks that may form from such a disc. Our model includes the physical evolution of the disc and the condensation, partial advection, and decoupling of the dust within it. The chemical composition of the condensate changes with time and radius. We compare the results of two dust condensation models: one where an element condenses when the mid-plane temperature in the disc is lower than the 50 per cent condensation temperature ($\rm T_\{50\}$) of that element and the other where the condensation of the dust is calculated by a Gibbs free energy minimization technique assuming chemical equilibrium at local disc temperature and pressure. The results of two models are generally consistent with some systematic differences of ∼10 per cent depending upon the radial distance and an element's condensation temperature. Both models predict compositions similar to CM, CO, and CV chondrites provided that the decoupling time-scale of the dust is of the order of the evolution time-scale of the disc or longer. If the decoupling time-scale is too short, the composition deviates significantly from the measured values. These models may contribute to our understanding of the chemical compositions of chondrites, and ultimately the terrestrial planets in the Solar system, and may constrain the potential chemical compositions of rocky exoplanets.},

Ballistic water-vapor deposition results in the growth of smooth,-I &(0.2 pm, ice needles. The amorphous ice seems to exist in at least two separate forms, at T & 85 K and at 85 & T & 136.8 K, and transforms irreversibly from one form to the other through a series of temperature-dependent metastable states. The channels formed by the water hexagons in the ice are wide enough to allow the free penetration of H& and D2 into the ice matrix even in the relatively compact cubic ice, resulting in H2-(D2-) to-ice ratios (by number) as high as 0.63. The larger Ar atoms can penetrate only into the wider channels of amorphous ice, and Ne is an intermediate case. Dynamic percolation behavior explains the emergence of Ar and Ne (but not H2 and D2) from the ice, upon warming, in small and big gas jets. The big jets, each containing-5&(10' atoms, break and propel the ice needles. Dynamic percolation also explains the collapse of the ice matrix under bombardment by Ar, at a pressure exceeding 2.6 dyncm and the burial of huge amounts of gas inside the collapsed matrix, up to an Ar-to-ice ratio of 3.3 (by number). The experimental results could be relevant to comets, icy satellites, and icy grain mantles in dense interstellar clouds.},

   abstract = {Ices regulate much of the chemistry during star formation and account for up to 80% of the available oxygen and carbon. In this paper, we use the Spitzer c2d Legacy ice survey, complimented with data sets on ices in cloud cores and high-mass protostars, to determine standard ice abundances and to present a coherent picture of the evolution of ices during low- and high-mass star formation. The median ice composition H2O:CO:CO2:CH 3OH:NH3:CH4:XCN is 100:29:29:3:5:5:0.3 and 100:13:13:4:5:2:0.6 toward low- and high-mass protostars, respectively, and 100:31:38:4:-:-:- in cloud cores. In the low-mass sample, the ice abundances with respect to H2O of CH4, NH3, and the component of CO2 mixed with H2O typically vary by <25%, indicative of co-formation with H2O. In contrast, some CO and CO2 ice components, XCN, and CH3OH vary by factors 2-10 between the lower and upper quartile. The XCN band correlates with CO, consistent with its OCN- identification. The origin(s) of the different levels of ice abundance variations are constrained by comparing ice inventories toward different types of protostars and background stars, through ice mapping, analysis of cloud-to-cloud variations, and ice (anti-)correlations. Based on the analysis, the first ice formation phase is driven by hydrogenation of atoms, which results in an H2O-dominated ice. At later prestellar times, CO freezes out and variations in CO freezeout levels and the subsequent CO-based chemistry can explain most of the observed ice abundance variations. The last important ice evolution stage is thermal and UV processing around protostars, resulting in CO desorption, ice segregation, and the formation of complex organic molecules. The distribution of cometary ice abundances is consistent with the idea that most cometary ices have a protostellar origin. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

The level of porosity of interstellar ices - largely comprised of amorphous solid water (ASW) - contains clues on the trapping capacity of other volatile species and determines the surface accessibility that is needed for solid state reactions to take place. Aims. Our goal is to simulate the growth of amorphous water ice at low temperature (10 K) and to characterize the evolution of the porosity (and the specific surface area) as a function of temperature (from 10 to 120 K). Methods. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations are used to mimic the formation and the thermal evolution of pores in amorphous water ice. We follow the accretion of gas-phase water molecules as well as their migration on surfaces with different grid sizes, both at the top growing layer and within the bulk. Results. We show that the porosity characteristics change substantially in water ice as the temperature increases. The total surface of the pores decreases strongly while the total volume decreases only slightly for higher temperatures. This will decrease the overall reaction efficiency, but in parallel, small pores connect and merge, allowing trapped molecules to meet and react within the pores network, providing a pathway to increase the reaction efficiency. We introduce pore coalescence as a new solid state process that may boost the solid state formation of new molecules in space and has not been considered so far.},

This article aims to provide an alternative method of measuring the porosity of multi-phase composite ices from their refractive indices and of characterising how the abundance of a premixed contaminant (e.g., CO 2) affects the porosity of water-rich ice mixtures during omni-directional deposition. Methods. We combine optical laser interference and extended effective medium approximations (EMAs) to measure the porosity of three astrophysically relevant ice mixtures: H2O:CO2 = 10:1, 4:1, and 2:1. Infrared spectroscopy is used as a benchmarking test of this new laboratory-based method. Results. By independently monitoring the O-H dangling modes of the different water-rich ice mixtures, we confirm the porosities predicted by the extended EMAs. We also demonstrate that CO2 premixed with water in the gas phase does not significantly affect the ice morphology during omni-directional deposition, as long as the physical conditions favourable to segregation are not reached. We propose a mechanism in which CO2 molecules diffuse on the surface of the growing ice sample prior to being incorporated into the bulk and then fill the pores partly or completely, depending on the relative abundance and the growth temperature. © 2014 ESO.},

   abstract = {<p> The porous nature of amorphous solid water (ASW) can significantly effect the chemical evolution of any planetary or astrophysical surface it forms on due to its ability to trap and retain volatiles. The amount of volatiles that can enter an ASW grain or mantle is limited by how interconnected the pores are to each other and to the exterior surface. Previous laboratory studies examined the interconnectivity of ASW pores in thin ASW films relevant to ice mantles on interstellar grains. Here, we investigate to what extent the interconnectivity of pores and subsequent gas absorption properties of ASW change as one moves toward thicker samples (up to ∼10 <sup>19</sup> H <sub>2</sub> O cm <sup>−2</sup> or ∼4 <italic>μ</italic> m) more representative of icy material found in the outer solar system. We find that for all film thicknesses studied, the internal pores are accessible from the sample’s surface, and the amount of gas needed to fill the pores increases linearly with the ASW column density. This linear relation supports that the interconnectivity to the surface will persist in ices that are much thicker than those we were able to study, suggesting that the amount of contaminant gas trapped within ASW can significantly alter the chemical evolution of a variety of ASW-rich surfaces in the outer solar system. </p>},

In the other case, the ASW film was deposited on top of a decane layer and not capped ("no cap" configuration). Crystallization of ASW films in the "sandwich" configuration is about eight times slower than in the "no cap." Selective placement of an isotopic layer (5% D2O in H2O) at various positions in an ASW (H2O) film was used to determine the crystallization mechanism. In the "sandwich" configuration, the crystallization kinetics were independent of the isotopic layer placement whereas in the "no cap" configuration the closer the isotopic layer was to the vacuum interface, the earlier the isotopic layer crystallized. These results are consistent with a mechanism whereby the decane overlayer suppresses surface nucleation and provide evidence that the observed ASW crystallization in "sandwich" films is the result of uniform bulk nucleation.},

This notion is pursued in the following section dealing with thermodynamic and relaxational properties, where the uniquely low excess entropy of the vitreous state of water is confirmed by three different estimates. The fact that the most nearly ideal glass known has no properly established glass transition temperature is highlighted, using known dielectric loss data for amorphous solid water (ASW) and relevant molecular glasses.

A substantial density gap between low-density amorphous (LDA) and the high-density amorphous ices (HDA) with liquid water in the middle is a cornerstone of our current understanding of water. However, here we show that ball milling 'ordinary' ice Ih at low temperature gives a structurally distinct medium-density amorphous ice (MDA) within this density gap. These results raise the possibility that MDA is the true glassy state of liquid water or alternatively a heavily sheared crystalline state. Remarkably, the compression of MDA at low temperature leads to a sharp increase of its recrystallization enthalpy highlighting that H2O can be a high-energy geophysical material.

A total of 15 unblended transitions of HOCH$_2$CN were identified. Our analysis indicates the presence of a cold (T$\rm _\{ex\}$=24$\pm$8$\,$K) and a warm (T$\rm _\{ex\}$=158$\pm$38$\,$K) component meaning that this molecule is present in both the inner hot corino and the outer cold envelope of IRAS16293 B. The relative abundance with respect to H$_2$ is (6.5$\pm$0.6)$\times$10$^\{-11\}$ and $\geq$(6$\pm$2)$\times$10$^\{-10\}$ for the warm and cold components respectively. Our chemical modelling seems to underproduce the observed abundance for both the warm and cold component under various values of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate ($\zeta$).

Radicals form readily when interstellar ices (composed of water and other volatiles) are exposed to UV photons and other sources of dissociative radiation, and, if sufficiently mobile, the radicals can react to form larger, more complex molecules. The resulting complex organic molecules (COMs) accompany star and planet formation, and may eventually seed the origins of life on nascent planets. Experiments of increasing sophistication have demonstrated that known interstellar COMs as well as the prebiotically interesting amino acids can form through ice photochemistry. We review these experiments and discuss the qualitative and quantitative kinetic and mechanistic constraints they have provided. We finally compare the effects of UV radiation with those of three other potential sources of radical production and chemistry in interstellar ices: electrons, ions and X-rays.},

Aminoacetonitrile is an interstellar molecule with a prominent prebiotic role, already detected in the chemically-rich molecular cloud Sagittarius B2(N) and postulated to be present in the atmosphere of the largest Saturn's moon, Titan. To further support its observation in such remote environments and laboratory experiments aimed at improving our understanding of interstellar chemistry, we report a thorough spectroscopic and structural characterization of aminoacetonitrile. Equilibrium geometry, fundamental bands as well as spectroscopic and molecular parameters have been accurately computed by exploiting a composite scheme rooted in the coupled-cluster theory that accounts for the extrapolation to the complete basis set limit and core-correlation effects. In addition, a semi-experimental approach that combines ground-state rotational constants for different isotopic species and calculated vibrational corrections has been employed for the structure determination. From the experimental side, we report the analysis of the three strongest fundamental bands of aminoacetonitrile observed between 500 and 1000 cm −1 in high-resolution infrared spectra. More generally, all computed band positions are in excellent agreement with the present and previous experiments. The only exception is the ν 15 band, for which we provide a revision of the experimental assignment, now in good agreement with theory. },

This interaction was attributed to strong hydrogen bonding which weakens upon warming as the acetonitrile molecules phase segregate from water-ice. Complete phase separation was observed at 130 K prior to desorption of acetonitrile from the water-ice matrix. Such a hydrogen-bonded structure is not observed when both the molecular solids are deposited as water on acetonitrile or acetonitrile on water overlayers.

Molecules are seen in environments that span a wide range of physical and chemical conditions and that clearly were created by a multitude of chemical processes, many of which differ substantially from those associated with traditional equilibrium chemistry. The wide range of environmental conditions and processes involved with chemistry in space yields complex populations of materials, and because the elements H, C, O, and N are among the most abundant in the universe, many of these are organic in nature, including some of direct astrobiological interest. Much of this chemistry occurs in "dense"interstellar clouds and protostellar disks surrounding forming stars because these environments have higher relative densities and more benign radiation fields than in stellar ejectae or the diffuse interstellar medium. Because these are the environments in which new planetary systems form, some of the chemical species made in these environments are expected to be delivered to the surfaces of planets where they can potentially play key roles in the origin of life. Because these chemical processes are universal and should occur in these environments wherever they are found, this implies that some of the starting materials for life are likely to be widely distributed throughout the universe.},

In the case of amorphous nanomaterials, thermal stability distinctively different from that of bulk materials often emerges. Despite intensive studies in the past, a thorough understanding of the stability at the molecular level has not been reached particularly on how crystallization processes depend on size and are influenced by their surface and interface. In this article, we report the film-size-dependent crystallization of thermally relaxed nonporous ASW ultrathin films on a Pt(111) surface as a benchmark system of amorphous molecular films. The crystallization processes at the surface and interior of the ASW ultrathin films are monitored simultaneously with thermal desorption and infrared reflection absorption, respectively, as a function of the film thickness. Here, we demonstrate that the crystallization is initiated solely by "homogeneous nucleation" irrespective of the film thickness while the crystallization rate remarkably depends on the thickness; the rate of 5-layer (∼1.5 nm) ASW films is one order of magnitude higher than that of 20-layer (∼6 nm) films. Moreover, we found a clear correlation between the film-thickness-dependent crystallization kinetics and microscopic structural disorder associated with the broad distribution of hydrogen-bond lengths between water molecules.},

The observed self-diusion in the 150±160 K range is roughly a millionfold greater than that expected for crystalline ice. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the self-diusivity are consistent with an amorphous solid that melts into a deeply supercooled liquid prior to crystallization. The overall temperature dependence for the diusivity of liquid water, supercooled liquid water (238±273 K), and of ASW (150±160 K) is well described by the Vogel±Fulcher±Tamman equation. These results suggest that ASW above its T g is a deeply supercooled metastable extension of normal liquid water prior to crystallizing near 160 K. Additionally, rapid H/D isotopic exchange occurs in concert with the translational diusive motion. Ó},

In the interstellar medium, complex molecules are detected in the denser sources only. Although, with one exception, complex molecules have only been detected in the gas phase, there is strong evidence that they can be formed in ice mantles on interstellar grains. The nature of the gaseous complex species depends dramatically on the source where they are found: in cold, dense regions they tend to be unsaturated (hydrogen-poor) and exotic, whereas in young stellar objects, they tend to be quite saturated (hydrogen-rich) and terrestrial in nature. Based on both their spectra and chemistry, complex molecules are excellent probes of the physical conditions and history of the sources where they reside. Because they are detected in young stellar objects, complex molecules are expected to be common ingredients for new planetary systems.

   abstract = {From August to November 2014 the Rosetta orbiter has performed an extensive observation campaign aimed at the characterization of 67P/CG nucleus properties and to the selection of the Philae landing site. The campaign led to the production of a global map of the illuminated portion of 67P/CG nucleus. During this prelanding phase the comet's heliocentric distance decreased from 3.62 to 2.93 AU while Rosetta was orbiting around the nucleus at distances between 100 to 10 km. VIRTIS-M, the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer - Mapping channel (Coradini et al., [2007] Space Sci. Rev., 128, 529-559) onboard the orbiter, has acquired 0.25-5.1 μm hyperspectral data of the entire illuminated surface, e.g. the north hemisphere and the equatorial regions, with spatial resolution between 2.5 and 25 m/pixel. I/F spectra have been corrected for thermal emission removal in the 3.5-5.1 μm range and for surface's photometric response. The resulting reflectance spectra have been used to compute several Cometary Spectral Indicators (CSI): single scattering albedo at 0.55 μm, 0.5-0.8 μm and 1.0-2.5 μm spectral slopes, 3.2 μm organic material and 2.0 μm water ice band parameters (center, depth) with the aim to map their spatial distribution on the surface and to study their temporal variability as the nucleus moved towards the Sun. Indeed, throughout the investigated period, the nucleus surface shows a significant increase of the single scattering albedo along with a decrease of the 0.5-0.8 and 1.0-2.5 μm spectral slopes, indicating a flattening of the reflectance. We attribute the origin of this effect to the partial removal of the dust layer caused by the increased contribution of water sublimation to the gaseous activity as comet crossed the frost-line. The regions more active at the time of these observations, like Hapi in the neck/north pole area, appear brighter, bluer and richer in organic material than the rest of the large and small lobe of the nucleus. The parallel coordinates method (Inselberg [1985] Vis. Comput., 1, 69-91) has been used to identify associations between average values of the spectral indicators and the properties of the geomorphological units as defined by (Thomas et al., [2015] Science, 347, 6220) and (El-Maarr et al., [2015] Astron. Astrophys., 583, A26). Three classes have been identified (smooth/active areas, dust covered areas and depressions), which can be clustered on the basis of the 3.2 μm organic material's band depth, while consolidated terrains show a high variability of the spectral properties resulting being distributed across all three classes. These results show how the spectral variability of the nucleus surface is more variegated than the morphological classes and that 67P/CG surface properties are dynamical, changing with the heliocentric distance and with activity processes.},

   abstract = {Although water vapour is the main species observed in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and water is the major constituent of cometary nuclei, limited evidence for exposed water-ice regions on the surface of the nucleus has been found so far. The absence of large regions of exposed water ice seems a common finding on the surfaces of many of the comets observed so far. The nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko appears to be fairly uniformly coated with dark, dehydrated, refractory and organic-rich material. Here we report the identification at infrared wavelengths of water ice on two debris falls in the Imhotep region of the nucleus. The ice has been exposed on the walls of elevated structures and at the base of the walls. A quantitative derivation of the abundance of ice in these regions indicates the presence of millimetre-sized pure water-ice grains, considerably larger than in all previous observations. Although micrometre-sized water-ice grains are the usual result of vapour recondensation in ice-free layers, the occurrence of millimetre-sized grains of pure ice as observed in the Imhotep debris falls is best explained by grain growth by vapour diffusion in ice-rich layers, or by sintering. As a consequence of these processes, the nucleus can develop an extended and complex coating in which the outer dehydrated crust is superimposed on layers enriched in water ice. The stratigraphy observed on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is therefore the result of evolutionary processes affecting the uppermost metres of the nucleus and does not necessarily require a global layering to have occurred at the time of the cometa's formation.},

D/H has been observed in the coma of many comets, but most such measurements have been for gaseous water. We present the first in situ measurements of the D/H ratios in the organic refractory component of cometary dust particles collected at very low impact speeds in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P) by the COSIMA instrument onboard Rosetta. The values measured by COSIMA are spatial averages over an approximately 35 × 50 μm2 area. The average D/H ratio for the 25 measured particles is (1.57 ± 0.54) × 10-3, about an order of magnitude higher than the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), but more than an order of magnitude lower than the values measured in gas-phase organics in solar-like protostellar regions and hot cores. This relatively high averaged value suggests that refractory carbonaceous matter in comet 67P is less processed than the most primitive insoluble organic matter (IOM) in meteorites, which has a D/H ratio in the range of about 1 to 7 × 10-4. The cometary particles measured in situ also have a higher H/C ratio than the IOM. We deduce that the measured D/H in cometary refractory organics is an inheritance from the presolar molecular cloud from which the Solar system formed. The high D/H ratios observed in the cometary particles challenges models in which high D/H ratios result solely from processes that operated in the protosolar disc.},

Despite its prevalence, I h remains an enigmatic solid, in part due to challenges in preparing samples for fundamental studies. Surfaces of ice present even greater challenges. Recently developed methods for preparation of large single-crystal samples make it possible to reproducibly prepare any chosen face to address numerous fundamental questions. This review describes preparation methods along with results that firmly establish the connection between the macroscopic structure (ob-served in snowflakes, microcrystallites, or etch pits) and the molecular-level configuration (detected with X-ray or electron scattering techniques). Selected results of probing interactions at the ice surface, including growth from the melt, surface vibrations, and characterization of the quasi-liquid layer, are discussed.},

By setting the snow line at its condensation level in the protosolar disk, water was responsible for separating the planets into the terrestrial and the giant ones. Water ice is a major constituent of the comets and the small bodies of the outer Solar System, and water vapor is found in the giant planets, both in their interiors and in the stratospheres. Water is a trace element in the atmospheres of Venus and Mars today. It is very abundant on Earth, mostly in liquid form, but it was probably also abundant in the primitive atmospheres of Venus and Mars. Water is found in different states on the three planets, as vapor on Venus and ice (or permafrost) on Mars. Most likely, this difference has played a major role in the diverging destinies of the three planets. Copyright © 2008 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

This review summarizes the detected infrared spectroscopic ice features and compares the abundances across Galactic, extragalactic, and Solar System environments. A tremendous amount of information is contained in the ice band profiles. Laboratory experiments play a critical role in the analysis of the observations. Strong evidence is found for distinct ice formation stages, separated by CO freeze-out at high densities. The ice bands have proven to be excellent probes of the thermal history of their environment. The evidence for the long-held idea that processing of ices by energetic photons and cosmic rays produces complex molecules is weak. Recent state-of-the-art observations show promise for much progress in this area with planned infrared facilities.},

The findings show that the cold regions of the early Solar System were not isolated and were not a refuge where interstellar materials could commonly survive. Wild 2, the sampled comet, appears to be a typical active Jupiter family comet, and yet most of its sampled micron and larger grains are familiar high-temperature meteoritic materials, such as chondrule fragments, that were transported to cold nebular regions. The rocky components in primitive asteroids and comets may differ because asteroid formation was dominated by local materials, whereas comets formed from mixed materials, many of which were transported from very distant locations. © 2014 by Annual Reviews.

   abstract = {Key Words molecular clouds, solar system, carbon chemistry, origin of life, astrobiology s Abstract Our understanding of the evolution of organic molecules, and their voyage from molecular clouds to the early solar system and Earth, has changed dramatically. Incorporating recent observational results from the ground and space, as well as laboratory simulation experiments and new methods for theoretical modeling, this review recapitulates the inventory and distribution of organic molecules in different environments. The evolution, survival, transport, and transformation of organ-ics is monitored, from molecular clouds and the diffuse interstellar medium to their incorporation into solar system material such as comets and meteorites. We constrain gas phase and grain surface formation pathways to organic molecules in dense interstellar clouds, using recent observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and ground-based radiotelescopes. The main spectroscopic evidence for car-bonaceous compounds in the diffuse interstellar medium is discussed (UV bump at 2200Å2200˚2200Å, diffuse interstellar bands, extended red emission, and infrared absorption and emission bands). We critically review the signatures and unsolved problems related to the main organic components suggested to be present in the diffuse gas, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fullerenes, diamonds, and carbonaceous solids. We also briefly discuss the circumstellar formation of organics around late-type stars. In the solar system, space missions to comet Halley and observations of the bright comets Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp have recently allowed a reexamination of the organic chemistry of dust and volatiles in long-period comets. We review the advances in this area and also discuss progress being made in elucidating the complex organic inventory of carbonaceous meteorites. The knowledge of organic chemistry in molecular clouds, comets, and meteorites and their common link provides constraints for the processes that lead to the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the Galaxy.},

This study was undertaken by means of molecular dynamics simulations. For CO<inf>2</inf> for which no experimental data were available we conducted our own experiments. From our calculations we show that, at low temperatures, the diffusion of molecules in the bulk of a LDA ice is driven by the self-diffusion of water molecules in the ice. With this study we demonstrate that molecular dynamics allows the calculation of diffusion coefficients for small molecules in LDA ice that are convincingly comparable to experimentally measured diffusion coefficients. We also provide diffusion coefficients for a series of molecules of astrochemical interest. This journal is},

This study shows that at pressures >1 GPa the crystallisation behaviour of VHDA and uHDA is basically the same for all heating rates. That is, parallel crystallisation is almost entirely suppressed with mainly ice XII forming. This contrasts former results reporting parallel crystallisation to approximately levelled phase mixtures of ice IV and ice XII even at higher pressures for uHDA. We speculate this to be due to formation of microcracks upon decompression in earlier works, but not in the present one. Crystallisation temperatures T x are up to 16 K higher than previously reported, raising the low-temperature border to no man's land and opening a considerably larger window for future studies on non-crystalline water. The results indicate uHDA to contain heterogeneities on the nanoscale, but VHDA to be rather homogeneous with nano-crystallites being largely absent. Upon transforming uHDA to VHDA, the nano-scale heterogeneities disappear for >1 GPa whereas microcracks do not.},
