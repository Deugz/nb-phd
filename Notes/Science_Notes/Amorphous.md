### <strong>&#187;  <u> Discovery and early history </u></strong>
    
The first experimental description of amorphous water ice has been achieved in 1935 by {cite:p}`Burton1935` that deposited water vapor on a copper rod maintained at -155 &#x2103;. It has since been an intense subject of research

```{admonition} Questions

- difference between vitreous material and amorphous solid ?

- Glassy vs vitreous ?

```

{cite:p}`Narten1976` showed that different deposition temperatures using the same vapor deposition setup and methodology would lead to two different forms of amorphous ice, where those differences are inferred from diffraction data (both Neutron and X-Ray):

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}

Ice deposited at 77K is **low density**

^^^

- Diffraction pattern consistent with a structure that has oxygen-oxygen nearest-neighbor tetrahedral symmetry on average, and a  nearest neighbor 0-0 separation of 2.76 &#8491 with **small dispersion**; -> *What is meant by this ?*
- Density estimated 0.94 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>

:::
:::{grid-item-card}
Ice deposited at 10K is **high density**
^^^

- Diffraction pattern similar to, yet distinctively different from, that of the high temperature deposit. The 0-0 nearest neighbor distance is the same. 2.76 &#8491 but the **dispersion in this separation is larger in the low temperature form**.
- Diffraction pattern shows an extra peak at 3.3 &#8491. corresponding to about 1.4 molecules. the existence of which is responsible for the **estimated** higher density, namely 1.1 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>

When subject to increasing pressure, amorphous ice **soften (what is meant by this ?)** and then suddenly collapse to a denser but still amorphous phase. This result is verified by computer simulations where density and structure of the high density amorphous form depends on the **potential function** chosen to represent the water.
- to verify (ref 5 - 7) simulation 8-9

Despite the non-crytalline nature of the molecular arrangements in LDA, both the thermodynamic state and
the vibrational characteristics are those of a highly ordered substance.  The **heat carrying phonons** of low temperature amorphous water behave like those in a crystal.
- What does this mean, where does it come from ?
Similar (but less dramatic) behaviour have been observed in other tetrahedrally coordinated solid (SiO2, GeO2, ZNCl2 etc). 


### ASW

Vapor deposition methods were employed to prepare ASW for the following studies:

- Calorimetry

- Spectroscopy

- vapor pressure and free energy

- **Crystalisation** 33,35,34,36 
    - {cite:p}`Jenniskens1996`
    - {cite:p}`Safarik2003` - Thickness dependance, Investigated by TPD
    - model : 78 - 79

- Dielectric relaxation

- Neutron and X-ray diffraction structure studies

- diffusion studies

- electron microscope

- vibrational dynamics studies (by neutron scattering)

- Thermal conductivity studies

The sharp crystallization exotherm commencing in the range of 150–160 K during reheating is the one universal feature of all previous studies of ASW or vitreous water.

#### Other preparation techniques

- cold microtoming method (68)

- decompression amorphization (73)

- electron bombardment vitrification (67, 76, 76a) - could be compatible with accoustic levitation

- radiation damage–induced vitrification (77)

-  phase-separation vitrification (12)

- plunge freeze (67)

```{note}
strong upswing in heat capacity seen in bulk laboratory supercooling water (81)

Heat capacity increase is also a main varying parameter obeserved during glass transition (Tg)

Narten et al. (39) 
- random structure of ASW. 
- second form of ASW - additional peak at 3.3  ̊Angstrom (interstitial water molecule) - Higher density (observed at 10K)
- First indication of the existence of polyamorphism

do they coexist in metastable equilibrium Mishima 5-7

#### Influence of the Substrate

- {cite:p}`Smith1996`
    - **desorption kinetics** are substrate dependent and suggest strongly that the film morphology is governed by the   hydrophilicity of the substrate.
    - **crystallization kinetics** are independent of substrate but depend strongly on both temperature and film thickness and are consistent with a *spatially random nucleation and isotropic growth model*.
    
- {cite:p}`Dohnalek2000`
    - dramatic acceleration of the crystallization rate is observed for amorphous films on crystalline ice substrates
    - crystallization-induced cracking of the films

### Amorphous vs Crystaline Ice

How does amorphous ices differs from its crystaline conterpart ? Well it depends on the formation route
of the amorphous ice.

#### Differential Scanning Calorimetry
    
tg at 136K (ramp 30K.min-1) --> Increase in heat capacity (lower than other amorphous solid: similar to SiO2 - GeO2) --> Imply limited number of entropically different configurational states in the fluid state following tg

Dielectric relaxation behaviour expected to be determined by two processes both involving a thermaly activated dipolar reorientation:
- translational-rotational diffusion of water molecules if the whole H-Bonded network relaxed within limitation of entropically different configurations
- rotational diffusion of water molecules within a fixed H-Bonded structure as breaches of the Bernal-Fowler rules. --> 2 kinds of Bjerrum defects
