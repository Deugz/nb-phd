# Water Ice



We are all familiar with water. Even though water is a relatively simple molecule, the third most abundant molecule in the Universe (after H2 and CO), and the most abundant molecule on Earth it not yet and far from being completely understood.

## **Water molecule**

Water is ... very important:
- Solar radiation absorbed by the Earth atmosphere is mostly due to water vapour absorption. {cite:p}`Lechevalier2018`
- Key molecule for life ...

It is commonly stated that the presence of liquid water is a necessary condition for the appearance of life:
- Hydratation properties for biological macromolecules
    - determine their 3D structures and biological functions in solutions (sol-gel phase transition ?)
- ...

**Water is more than just a solvent**

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u> Properties </u></strong></h3>

<h4><strong> Anomalous macroscopic behaviour </strong></h4>

Water molecules are symetric (point group C<sub>2V</sub> - two mirror planes of symmetry and a 2-fold rotation axis).
- Is it important ?

Isotopologues are a great investigation tool to unveil the various processes that a molecular species has had to overcome over it's existence.






<h4><strong> Hydrogen bonding </strong></h4>

<h5><strong> Definition </strong></h5>

:::::{div} full-width

```{epigraph}
The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X–H in which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is evidence of bond formation.

-- IUPAC definition, 2011 (to cite)
```

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item}
:columns: 6

Hydrogen bonds are the most important stabilizing interaction in nature, playing a key role in the structure of proteins and DNA. First described by Linus Pauling in a letter to William Bragg in 1929.

- copy pasted (rewrite)

The potential energy function of the free AH
group is thus modified by the potential B; it becomes broader and the
vibrational levels become closer as reflected by the shift of the AH
stretching band toward lower frequencies shown by infrared and Raman
spectroscopy. At the same time, the proton of the AH group shifts toward
B and the equilibrium r (A--H) distance increases while the intermolecular
R (A.. B) distance decreases to a value less than the sum of the Van
der Waals radii of the A and B atoms. The geometrical changes have been
detected by neutron and X-ray diffraction methods (1--4).

<h6><strong> Different types of Hydrogen bonds ?</strong></h6>

- linear
- bifurcated - {cite:p}`Giguere1984` 


<h5><strong> Molecular interaction </strong></h5>

<h6><strong> Geometry </strong></h6>

Best way to study intermolecular interaction is in the solid phase, at low temerature (reduce molecular movement ....)

The basic principles that govern the arrangement of atoms in water ice are called the ice rules (or Bernal–Fowler rules) and they state that each oxygen is covalently bonded to two hydrogen atoms and that the oxygen atom in each water molecule forms two hydrogen bonds with other water molecules. As a result, each water molecule is embeded in a teraedron formed by four neighbouring molecules, called a **Walrafen pentamer**

This tetrahedral geometry is caused by the ability of water to form <strong>4 hydrogen bonds</strong> with other water molecules:
- 2 donors (D) from the 2 hydrogens
- 2 acceptors (A) from the Oxygen lone pairs of electrons

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u> Investigation techniques  </u></strong></h3>

One of the major issue in obtaining a consensus about water structure is the broad range of technique that are used to investigate it's properties.

what these underlying absorption peaks represent? 
- Is it the number of H bonds that is important {cite:p}`Walrafen1972`

- HB bending angle ? {cite:p}`Moller2004`
- Nature of the formed or broken donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds {cite:p}`Millo2005`
- length of the hydrogen bonds {cite:p}`Schmidt2007`

The absorption bands also reflect **coherent vibrational transfer** involving several to many water molecules - {cite:p}`Yang2010` (liquid water work)
