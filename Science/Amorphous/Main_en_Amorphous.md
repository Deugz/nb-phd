# is Amorphous

Image_Pierre_ASW_void


Amorphous water ice, shapeless and still,
A formless beauty that seems to spill,
Over surfaces, with no defined shape,
A sight that's unique and hard to escape.

It's formed when water freezes fast,
And loses its structure in the cast,
Of cold and rapid freezing pace,
A sight that seems to hold its place.

It's found on comets, asteroids, and more,
A form of water that's hard to ignore,
A substance that's elusive and rare,
A beauty that's formed without a care.

It's a sight to behold, with its misty form,
A beauty that seems to weather the storm,
Of time and space, and endless nights,
A thing of beauty, pure and bright.

So let us marvel at amorphous ice,
A substance formed in a flash, precise,
A wonder that's hard to replicate,
A beauty that's formed without a mistake.

#### Differential Scanning Calorimetry
    
tg at 136K (ramp 30K.min-1) --> Increase in heat capacity (lower than other amorphous solid: similar to SiO2 - GeO2) --> Imply limited number of entropically different configurational states in the fluid state following tg

Dielectric relaxation behaviour expected to be determined by two processes both involving a thermaly activated dipolar reorientation:
- translational-rotational diffusion of water molecules if the whole H-Bonded network relaxed within limitation of entropically different configurations
- rotational diffusion of water molecules within a fixed H-Bonded structure as breaches of the Bernal-Fowler rules. --> 2 kinds of Bjerrum defects
