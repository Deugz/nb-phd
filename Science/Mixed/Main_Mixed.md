Ethane properties:
- volatile

Where is ethane found in the solar system ?
- Ice on solar stem bodies but also one of the more commonly form of **gas-phase hydrocarbons**
    - Pluto and other TNO's
    - Clouds of Titan (+ liquid phase)
    - **Cometary comae** - mixing with ASW ?

<h5><strong><u>Ethane + water</u></strong></h5>

- {cite:p}`Dartois2021` (Experimental method described in Dartois 2010, 2009, 2008)



<h6>Intro</h6>

Interaction of hydrocarbons with water ice at low temperatures could lead to the formation of <strong>clathrate hydrates</strong> (not to be confused with hydrates or ice mixture)

2 main crystalline clathrate hydrate <strong>cubic</strong>(?) structures:
- <span class="hovertext" data-hover="">Type 1 </span>
- <span class="hovertext" data-hover="">Type 2 </span>
For each structure, cage's number ratio and filling ratio with guest moleculesinfluence the spectroscopic signature of the trapped molecules (ethane)

```{note}
How is the water spectra modified?
```

Some models do include clathrate hydrates in the evolution of solar system bodies:
- Combe 2019
- ...

```{note}
Have a look later
- How is the water ice treated


- ethane:oxirane clathrate ({cite:p}`Richardson1985`)

```

<h6>Method</h6>

- Form ice Ih layer (several micron thick)
- Pressurized the chamber with ethane gas (25 bars) for 15 days! - diffusion kinetics ...

IR spectra steps of 20K

<h6>Results/Discussion</h6>

Pure ethane clathrate hydrate is exepected to be <strong>Type 1</strong> (good agreement between {cite:p}`Dartois2021` and {cite:p}`Richardson1985`).

**Main outcomes**: formation of an ethane clathrate hydrate gives rise to a very <strong>unique band pattern</strong>, distinct from the observed features of the various ethane phases.
- Band splitting in fundamental &mu;<sub>7</sub> degenerate mode region around 2970 cm<sup>-1</sup>
- ...

Unique IR feature can be allocate to ethane clathrate hydrate Type 1.

**But**

When species are mixed they can induce formation of type 2 clathrate hydrates {cite:p}`subramanian2000`

```{note}

- Ethane liquid density = 462.7 kg/m<sup>3</sup> - Younglove 1987
