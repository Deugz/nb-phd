# Questions ?

This page summarise the Science questions adressed in this work (Thesis Part 1)

## Chapter 3

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u> Amorphous Ice </u></strong></h3> 

<h4><strong>ASW structure</strong></h4>

<h5>Litterature</h5>

- Is there a high density - low density forms of ASW dependant on the Deposition temperature (around 80K ?)

**Depositions**

- Are the depositions of ASW reliable (ie what are the source of discrepencies between the different depositions)
<br>
**Hypothesis**: Thickness play a big role
**Ivestigation**: 02_09 sample (multiple small deposition steps)
    - If we perform a deconvolution of OH stretch, is it reliable ?


- Amorphous ice are free from long range ordering but is there a short range arrangement in ASW ?

- Can we describe the short range ordering using a network of hydrogen bonds

## Chapter 4

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u> ASW Crystalisation </u></strong></h3> 

<h4><strong>Kinetics</strong></h4>

- What order



## Chapter 5

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u> Ethane ice </u></strong></h3> 

We have produced a variety of ethane (only) depositions at various Temperature:

- 20
- 40 
- 60
- ...

***
**Depositions**
- Does our sample are in agreement with the values (Absorption peaks) found in the litterature

**Isotherm**
- Do we see a phase transition during the Isotherm scans and if so,
    - Can we obtain some kinetics about the phase transition

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u> Ethane + water </u></strong></h3> 

Variety of depositions condition

- Mixture

- Layers

- Sandwish
