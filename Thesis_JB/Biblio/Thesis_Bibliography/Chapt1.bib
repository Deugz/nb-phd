   abstract = {The dielectric permittivity and loss of vapor-deposited amorphous solid water (ASW) have been measured for fixed frequencies of 1 and 10 kHz from 80 K to its crystallization temperature. Similar measurements have also been made on the cubic ice formed after the crystallization of ASW and the hexagonal ice formed on heating the cubic ice. The loss tangent shows a broad sub-T g relaxation peak centered at about 100 K and an approach towards a plateau value which appears as a shoulder. The peak is attributed to thermally activated rotation of H2O molecules with one or two dangling OH groups on the surface of the pores of the microporous sample, and the shoulder to localized motions within the network structure. Sintering of the samples on thermal cycling between 77 and ≈120 K in vacuo causes the broad peak to vanish. With increase in temperature, above Tg, the loss tangent shows the emergence of the expected α-relaxation peak of a liquid at T>Tg, whose completion is terminated by the onset of crystallization to cubic ice at about the same temperature for 1 kHz and for 10 kHz measurements. Thereafter, crystallization becomes slower, thus allowing further observation of the low-temperature part of the α-relaxation peak. The dielectric loss of amorphous solid water at 80 K is nearly 20 times that of the cubic ice formed on its crystallization after heating to 193 K, and nearly 3.5 times higher at Tg. The dielectric loss of the cubic ice formed on crystallization tends towards a plateau value prior to rapidly increasing with increase in temperature, an evidence for a low temperature relaxation which vanishes on conversion to hexagonal ice. This relaxation indicates a remnant topologically disordered structure of intergranular water and/or stacking faults in cubic ice. Samples sintered by thermal cycling in vacuo to ≈120 K crystallized in one step, whereas those without prior thermal cycling crystallized in two steps to cubic ice. Annealing of the ASW at 130 K completely removes the broad peak at ≈100 K and reduces the magnitude of the β-relaxation process. Partial crystallization of ASW completely removes the β-relaxation process, which indicates either preferential crystallization at the local regions of high mobility in the amorphous matrix or a change in the structure of the amorphous phase during crystallization. © 1991 American Institute of Physics.},

The heat of crystallization of the annealed ASW to cubic ice is-1.29 f 0.01 kJ mol-'. These values are similar to those previously reported for hyperquenched glassy water. This similarity and the changes of the X-ray diffractograms feature indicate that ASW anneals or relaxes during heating in vacuo to a structural state approaching that of hyperquenched glassy water. Therefore, its state can be thermodynamically continuous with that of water, but its H-bonded structure is not likely to be the same as that of water at ambient temperature.},

The spectra of Ice Ih, while similar in their main features to those reported by earlier workers, differ significantly in detail, probably largely because much of the previous work, particularly on D2O ice, has been done with partly vitreous ice. The usual interpretation of the bands in terms of the v1, v2, v3, and vR vibrations of isolated molecules is greatly oversimplified because intermolecular coupling is important. There are at least six (five infrared and one Raman) bands due to O-D stretching vibrations in the spectrum of D2O Ice I, but the detailed origin is unknown. The breadth of the O-H and O-D stretching bands of HDO in dilute solution in D2O and H2O is interpreted as indicating a disarrangement of the oxygen positions due to the disorder of the hydrogen atoms.},

It is believed that pristine water is formed and grows on the surface of icy dust grains in dark interstellar clouds. Until now, there has been no experimental evidence whether this scenario is feasible or not on an astrophysically relevant template and by hydrogen and oxygen atom reactions. Aims. We present here the first experimental evidence of water synthesis by such a process on a realistic analogue of grain surface in dense clouds, i.e., amorphous water ice. Methods. Atomic beams of oxygen and deuterium are aimed at a porous water ice substrate (H2O) held at 10 K. Products are analyzed by the temperature-programmed desorption technique. Results. We observe the production of HDO and D2O, indicating that water is formed under conditions of the dense interstellar medium from hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

Phys. 138, 104502 (2013)10.1063/1.4793312), we investigate the mechanisms for the release of trapped gases from underneath amorphous solid water (ASW) films. In prior work, we reported the episodic release of trapped gases in concert with the crystallization of ASW, a phenomenon that we termed the molecular volcano. The observed abrupt desorption is due to the formation of cracks that span the film to form a connected pathway for release. In this paper, we utilize the molecular volcano desorption peak to characterize the formation of crystallization-induced cracks. We find that the crack length distribution is independent of the trapped gas (Ar, Kr, Xe, CH4, N2, O2, or CO). Selective placement of the inert gas layer is used to show that cracks form near the top of the film and propagate downward into the film. Isothermal experiments reveal that, after some induction time, cracks propagate linearly in time with an Arrhenius dependent velocity corresponding to an activation energy of 54 kJmol. This value is consistent with the crystallization growth rates reported by others and establishes a direct connection between crystallization growth rate and the crack propagation rate. A two-step model in which nucleation and crystallization occurs in an induction zone near the top of the film followed by the propagation of a crystallizationcrack front into the film is in good agreement with the temperature programmed desorption results. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.},

Their low temperatures (<10 K) allow the formation of thick icy dust mantles, which will be partially preserved in future protoplanetary disks, ultimately affecting the chemical composition of planetary systems. Previous observations have shown that carbon- and oxygen-bearing species, in particular CO, are heavily depleted in prestellar cores due to the efficient molecular freeze-out onto the surface of cold dust grains. However, N-bearing species such as NH 3 and, in particular, its deuterated isotopologues appear to maintain high abundances where CO molecules are mainly in the solid phase. Thanks to ALMA, we present here the first clear observational evidence of NH 2 D freeze-out toward the L1544 prestellar core, suggestive of the presence of a “complete depletion zone” within a ≃1800 au radius, in agreement with astrochemical prestellar core model predictions. Our state-of-the-art chemical model coupled with a non-LTE radiative transfer code demonstrates that NH 2 D becomes mainly incorporated in icy mantles in the central 2000 au and starts freezing out already at ≃7000 au. Radiative transfer effects within the prestellar core cause the NH 2 D(1 11 − 1 01 ) emission to appear centrally concentrated, with a flattened distribution within the central ≃3000 au, unlike the 1.3 mm dust continuum emission, which shows a clear peak within the central ≃1800 au. This prevented NH 2 D freeze-out from being detected in previous observations, where the central 1000 au cannot be spatially resolved. },

These small bodies in cold regions of the disks are typically considered as mixtures of dust particles with molecular ices, where ices cover the surface of a dust core or are actually physically mixed with dust. Whilst the first case, ice-on-dust, has been intensively studied in the laboratory in recent decades, the second case, ice-mixed-with-dust, present uncharted territory. This work is the first laboratory study of the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of water ice mixed with amorphous carbon and silicate grains. We show that the kinetics of desorption of H2O ice depends strongly on the dust/ice mass ratio, probably, due to the desorption of water molecules from a large surface of fractal clusters composed of carbon or silicate grains. In addition, it is shown that water ice molecules are differently bound to silicate grains in contrast to carbon. The results provide a link between the structure and morphology of small cosmic bodies and the kinetics of desorption of water ice included in them.},

   abstract = {The interactions of electromagnetic radiation with ice, and with ice-containing media such as snow and clouds, are determined by the refractive index and absorption coefficient (the 'optical constants') of pure ice as functions of wavelength. Bulk reflectance, absorptance and transmittance are further influenced by grain size (for snow), bubbles (for glacier ice and lake ice) and brine inclusions (for sea ice). Radiative transfer models for clouds can also be applied to snow; the important differences in their radiative properties are that clouds are optically thinner and contain smaller ice crystals than snow. Absorption of visible and near-ultraviolet radiation by ice is so weak that absorption of sunlight at these wavelengths in natural snow is dominated by trace amounts of light-absorbing impurities such as dust and soot. In the thermal infrared, ice is moderately absorptive, so snow is nearly a blackbody, with emissivity 98-99%. The absorption spectrum of liquid water resembles that of ice from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared.

Snow and ice are transparent to radio waves, so radar can be used to infer ice-sheet thickness.

For almost 120 years, it has been a stomping ground for scientific discovery, and ice research has often been a trailblazer for investigations into a wide range of materials-related phenomena. Here, the experimental progress of the last couple of years is reviewed, and open questions as well as future challenges are discussed. The specific topics include (i) the polytypism and stacking disorder of ice I, (ii) the mechanism of the pressure amorphization of ice I, (iii) the emptying of gas-filled clathrate hydrates to give new low-density ice polymorphs, (iv) the effects of acid/base doping on hydrogen-ordering phase transitions as well as (v) the formation of solid solutions between salts and the ice polymorphs, and the effect this has on the appearance of the phase diagram. In addition to continuing efforts to push the boundaries in terms of the extremes of pressure and temperature, the exploration of the "chemical" dimensions of ice research appears to now be a newly emerging trend. It is without question that ice research has entered a very exciting era.},

We here introduce these amorphous ices and discuss the question of how many of these forms are of relevance in the context of polyamorphism. We employ the criterion of reversible transitions between amorphous "states" in finite intervals of pressure and temperature to discriminate between independent metastable amorphous "states" and between "substates" of the same amorphous "state". We argue that the experimental evidence suggests we should consider there to be three polyamorphic "states" of ice, namely low-(LDA), high-(HDA) and very high-density amorphous ice (VHDA). In addition to the realization of reversible transitions between them, they differ in terms of their properties, e.g., compressibility, or number of "interstitial" water molecules. Thus they cannot be regarded as structurally relaxed variants of each other and so we suggest considering them as three distinct megabasins in an energy landscape visualization. © 2011 the Owner Societies.},

Although the global structure of this material, i.e. the bulk and the surface, is well characterised, we are far from having an overall understanding of the changes induced upon chemical or physical perturbation. More specifically, the behaviour of the surface and the immediate sublayers upon mid-infrared irradiation must be understood due to its direct effect on the adsorption capacities of the ASW surface. Small molecules can accrete or form at the surface, adsorbed on the dangling OH groups of surface water molecules. This behaviour allows further reactivity which, in turn, could lead to more complex molecular systems. We have already demonstrated that selective IR irradiations of surface water molecules induce a modification of the surface and the production of a new monomer species which bonds to the surface via its two electronic doublets. However, we did not probe the structure of the dangling bands, namely their homogeneity or inhomogeneity. The structure and orientation of these surface molecules are closely linked to the way the surface can relax its vibrational energy. In this work, we have focussed our attention on the two dH dangling bonds, carrying out a series of selective irradiations which reveal the inhomogeneity of these surface modes. We have also studied the effects of irradiation duration on the surface reorientation, determining that the maximum photoinduced isomerisation yield is ∼15%. This journal is},

   abstract = {Amorphous solid water (ASW) is one of the most widely studied molecular systems. Ubiquitous in the interstellar medium (ISM) and potentially present in the upper layers of the Earths atmosphere, ASW plays a major role in heterogeneous physical chemistry. Small molecules form or accrete at the ice surface, bonding to water molecules with an OH bond projecting from the surface, so-called dangling bonds. These dangling OH are of crucial importance in the quest to identify and quantify surface reactions. Water ices in the ISM or Earths atmosphere undergo constant processing by thermal and irradiation effects, which can significantly affect both the bulk and surface structures and therefore the catalytic properties of the surface. In this work we have studied thermal and irradiation processing of ASW and determine that there is a photochemical processing pathway of the ice surface which is clearly distinct from purely thermal effects. Selective IR irradiations of each of the surface water modes led to the observation of a hole-burning at the irradiation frequency, counterbalanced by the production of a new band, identified as a water monomer interacting with the surface. The thermal effects, meanwhile, led to a global decrease of all the dangling modes due to global reorganization of the water ice structure. It is thus obvious that, depending on the processing history of an ice, its catalytic properties will not be affected in the same way. The fact that we observe an IR selective irradiation effect illustrates that some fraction of the vibrational energy, rather than being relaxed through the H-bonded network of the bulk ice, is trapped at the surface; this energy induces a reorganization of the surface structure, forming new trapping sites, and thus generating new catalytic properties.},

Indeed, ASW is ubiquitous in the cold interstellar medium (ISM), where ASW-coated dust grains provide a catalytic surface for solid phase chemistry, and is believed to be present in the Earth's atmosphere at high altitudes. It has been shown that the ice surface adsorbs small molecules such as CO, N 2, or CH4, most likely at OH groups dangling from the surface. Our study presents completely new insights concerning the behavior of ASW upon selective infrared (IR) irradiation of its dangling modes. When irradiated, these surface H2O molecules reorganize, predominantly forming a stabilized monomer-like water mode on the ice surface. We show that we systematically provoke "hole-burning" effects (or net loss of oscillators) at the wavelength of irradiation and reproduce the same absorbed water monomer on the ASW surface. Our study suggests that all dangling modes share one common channel of vibrational relaxation; the ice remains amorphous but with a reduced range of binding sites, and thus an altered catalytic capacity. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Amorphous solid water (ASW) is abundantly present in the interstellar medium where it forms a mantle on interstellar dust particles and it is the precursor for cometary ices. In space, ASW acts as a substrate for interstellar surface chemistry leading to complex molecules and it is postulated to play a critical role in proton-transfer reactions. Although ASW is widely studied and is generally well characterized by different techniques, energetically induced structural changes, such as ion, electron, and photon irradiation, in these materials are less well understood. Selective pumping of specific infrared (IR) vibrational modes can aid in understanding the role of vibrations in restructuring of hydrogen-bonding networks. Here, we present the first experimental results on hydrogen-bonding changes in ASW induced by the intense, nearly monochromatic mid-IR free-electron laser (FEL) radiation of the FELIX-2 beamline at the FELIX Laboratory at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. The changes are monitored by reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy. Upon resonant irradiation, a modification in the IR absorption band profile of ASW is observed in agreement with a growing crystalline-like contribution and a decreasing amorphous contribution. This phenomenon saturates within a few minutes of FEL irradiation, modifying upward of 94% of the irradiated ice. The effect is further analyzed in terms of hydrogen-bonding donors and acceptors, and the experiments are complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to constrain the effect at the molecular level.},

   abstract = {The water ice on the three outermost Galilean satellites of Jupiter has a lattice structure that can vary from crystalline to amorphous. Amorphous ice is crystallized by heating, while crystalline ice is amorphized through disruption by particle radiation. We determine ice lattice order using infrared spectra from the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on the Galileo Jupiter orbiter. The shape of the reflectance peak near 3.1 μm is diagnostic of the lattice order in the top micrometers of the surface. A narrow, temperature-sensitive band near 1.65 μm, from ∼1 mm depth, is missing for amorphous ice. Spectral averages of >100 pixels were used for Europa and Callisto, because of high radiation noise and small ice amounts, respectively. Model comparisons show that the surface ice is predominantly amorphous on Europa and predominantly crystalline on Callisto, while both types of ice are found on Ganymede. The distribution of Ganymede ice properties shows a broad global pattern of more amorphous ice in the high-latitude Jovian-facing hemisphere and in the low-latitude trailing hemisphere. The ice at ∼1 mm depth on all three satellites is predominantly crystalline. The radiation flux increases by ∼300 times between Callisto and Europa, while the thermal crystallization rate may vary over five orders of magnitude among the three satellites (being the fastest at Callisto). The occurrence of crystalline and amorphous ice suggests a balance between the disruption and crystallization, with Callisto dominated by thermal crystallization and Europa by radiative disruption, and with nearly equal rates between the two processes at Ganymede.

It has been shown by the studies of Maisch (1956) and Ockman (1957) that it is not possible to obtain a unique solution to the structure problem of ice by measuring its polarized vibration spectrum. However, Maisch's observation of the constancy of the depolarization ratio across each of the bands in the hydrogen stretching region is a strong argument for a disordered structure. Satisfactory assignments have only been made for the three bands originating in the fundamental modes of the water molecule and for the six strong bands which can be correlated with the overtone and combination modes of the liquid and vapour spectra. An explicit characterization of the low frequency bands in terms of lattice motions must await a solution to the lattice-dynamical problem as well as a careful study of the low frequency, polarized spectra of single crystals. The solution to the dynamical problem of the ice lattice should make possible a determination of the crystal anharmonicities.

The supposed similarity between the spectra of ordered and disordered ice Ic is justified by the observed similarity of the spectra of ice VIII and VII, which are respectively ordered and disordered forms of the same structure and are closely related to ordered and disordered ice Ic. The assignment takes into account the intermolecular coupling, which is particularly strong for the v, vibrations but weak for the v,, and the TO-LO splitting, particularly of the v, vibrations, which is shown to be required by the high infrared intensity.

The sample is complemented with previously published Spitzer spectra of background stars and with ISO spectra of well-studied massive YSOs (L $ 10 5 L). The long-known 6.0 and 6.85 m bands are detected toward all sources, with the Class 0Y type YSOs showing the deepest bands ever observed. The 6.0 m band is often deeper than expected from the bending mode of pure solid H 2 O. The additional 5Y7 m absorption consists of five independent components, which, by comparison to laboratory studies, must be from at least eight different carriers. Much of this absorption is due to simple species likely formed by grain surface chemistry, at abundances of 1%Y30% for CH 3 OH, 3%Y8% for NH 3 , 1%Y5% for HCOOH, $6% for H 2 CO, and $0.3% for HCOO À relative to solid H 2 O. The 6.85 m band has one or two carriers, of which one may be less volatile than H 2 O. Its carrier(s) formed early in the molecular cloud evolution and do not survive in the diffuse ISM. If an NH þ 4-containing salt is the carrier, its abundance relative to solid H 2 O is $7%, demonstrating the efficiency of low-temperature acid-base chemistry or cosmic-rayYinduced reactions. Possible origins are discussed for enigmatic, very broad absorption between 5 and 8 m. Finally, the same ices are observed toward massive and low-mass YSOs, indicating that processing by internal UV radiation fields is a minor factor in their early chemical evolution.},

The crystalline clathrate films (∼6 μ) have been formed either by annealing amorphous host-guest deposits at ∼130 K, epitaxial growth at 110 K (oxirane and mixed ethane-oxirane), or direct deposition at 150 K (THF and its double clathrates). Use of the epitaxial approach at ∼100 K has permitted the formation of the oxirane clathrate hydrate containing intact isolated D2O molecules. This has permitted the FT-IR observation of the ν3-ν1 doublet in the O-D stretching region (2455 and 2380 cm-1 at 100 K) with the values, after correction for Fermi resonance, suggesting a splitting from intramolecular coupling of ∼56 cm-1 (2455 vs 2399 cm-1), which compares closely with the 52 cm-1 deduced for cubic ice. Spectra for the structure I hydrates of oxirane and H2S contain absorption bands produced by guest molecules confined to both small and large clathrate cages. Use of the structure II double hydrates has permitted the firm identification of the structure I infrared bands with oxirane and H2S molecules in cages of one size or the other. Thus, the weaker ν3 and (ν11, ν14) bands of oxirane at 1281 and 1152 cm-1 have been assigned to molecules in the small cages since only these oxirane features remain in the structure II double hydrate with THF. In this case the smaller oxirane molecules occupy the small cages while the THF molecules enter the larger cages, exclusively. In a similar manner, the H-S stretching vibrations of H2S in the structure I small cages have been assigned to a band complex near 2610 cm-1, some 50 cm-1 above the band system for H2S in the large structure I clathrate cages. Such a result suggests that the net H2S perturbation, relative to the gas phase, is greater for the large than for the small cages and may be interpreted as evidence for a "double well" large cage potential or as further evidence that the cage model of Pimentel and Charles for guest-molecule stretching modes is valid. © 1985 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {Volatile and organic-rich C-type asteroids may have been one of the main sources of Earth’s water. Our best insight into their chemistry is currently provided by carbonaceous chondritic meteorites, but the meteorite record is biased: only the strongest types survive atmospheric entry and are then modified by interaction with the terrestrial environment. Here we present the results of a detailed bulk and microanalytical study of pristine Ryugu particles, brought to Earth by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft. Ryugu particles display a close compositional match with the chemically unfractionated, but aqueously altered, CI (Ivuna-type) chondrites, which are widely used as a proxy for the bulk Solar System composition. The sample shows an intricate spatial relationship between aliphatic-rich organics and phyllosilicates and indicates maximum temperatures of ~30 °C during aqueous alteration. We find that heavy hydrogen and nitrogen abundances are consistent with an outer Solar System origin. Ryugu particles are the most uncontaminated and unfractionated extraterrestrial materials studied so far, and provide the best available match to the bulk Solar System composition.},

Raman band frequencies for ethane obtained from different CH 4 + C 2 H 6 hydrates at 274.2 K indicate a change in hydrate structure from sI to sII between 72.2 and 75 mole% of CH 4 in the vapor. A significant increase in the amount of methane incorporated into the hydrate is observed with change in hydrate structure from sI to sII. Solid-state 13 C CPMAS NMR measurements at 253 K confirm that CH 4 + C 2 H 6 gas mixtures can form sII hydrates at certain feed compositions.},

Since then, over a hundred different water models have been proposed. Despite being widely studied, water remains poorly understood. Examining the evolution of water models, we identified three distinct philosophies in water modelling, namely the employment of effective point charges in pioneering empirical models, the incorporation of polarization to describe many-body inductive effects and the extensive use of ab initio calculations to describe short-range effects. In doing so, we can appraise the current understanding of water and identify attributes that a water model should possess to capture the intricate interactions between water molecules.},

The aim of the present study is to compare the mid-infrared spectra of laboratory silicate grain/water ice mixtures with astronomical observations to evaluate the presence of dust/ice mixtures in interstellar and circumstellar environments. The laboratory data can explain the observations, assuming reasonable mass-averaged temperatures for the protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, demonstrating that a substantial fraction of water ice may be mixed with silicate grains. On the basis of the combination of laboratory data and infrared observations, we provide evidence of the presence of solid-state water in the diffuse interstellar medium. Our results have implications for future laboratory studies investigating cosmic dust grain analogues and for future observations trying to identify the structure, composition and temperature of grains in different astrophysical environments.},

   abstract = {<p>The desorption properties of H2O films are investigated across a wide range of film thicknesses from 53 nanometres (nm) to 101 micrometres (μm) using a quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) and temperature-programmed desorption. Three desorption stages are observed belonging to amorphous solid water (ASW), stacking disordered ice I (ice Isd), and hexagonal ice I (ice Ih). The desorption of ASW is only detectable for the ≥10 μm films and is separated from the ice I desorption by 10–15 K with an associated desorption energy of ∼64 kJ mol−1. The desorption energy of the 53-nm film was found to be near 50 kJ mol−1 as also noted in the literature, but with increasing film thickness, the desorption energy of ice I rises, reaching a plateau around 65–70 kJ mol−1. The reason for the increased desorption energy is suggested to be due to molecules unable to desorb due to the thick covering layer of H2O and possibly re-adsorption events. Before complete desorption of ice I at around 220 K for the 101 μm film, a two-stage ice I desorption is observed with the QCM for the ≥10 μm films near 200 K. This event corresponds to the desorption of ice Isd as corroborated by X-ray diffraction patterns collected upon heating from 92 to 260 K at ambient pressure. Cubic ice is not observed as is commonly stated in the literature as resulting from the crystallization of ASW. Therefore, ice Isd is the correct terminology for the initial crystallization product of ASW.</p>},

This study measures the ODSB/OHSB for isotopically substituted D2O/H2O (with volume ratio VD2O/VH2O of 1/0, 4/1, 1/1, 1/4 and 0/1) ice Ih, and compares them with those for liquid water and ices in various phases. The data show that istopic substitution (IS) narrows the ODSB/OHSB of ice from both the low-frequency and the high-frequency side to the middle of the OD/OH stretch regions, but in contrast, IS enhances the high-frequency part of the ODSB/OHSB for liquid water. The ODSB/OHSB features of ice and their dependences on IS and phase transition can be understood basically from the concept that ice has diverse HB configurations that depend on the ice lattice form and the proton (dis)order and essentially determine the intermolecular vibrational couplings in ice. Combined with a Gaussian fitting analysis, more details for the HB configurations in ice are revealed: tetrahedral HB profiles, which are responsible for the main peak, are dominant and non-tetrahedral ones, which bring about the high-frequency shoulders, are also important. On IS, the proportion of tetrahedral HB profiles sees a dramatic decrease.},

   abstract = {It is considered that hydrophobic solutes dissolve in water via the formation of icelike cages in the first hydration shell. However, this conventional picture is currently under debate. We have investigated how hydrophobic species, such as D2, Ne, Ar, Xe, CH4, and C3H8, interact with water in composite films of amorphous solid water (ASW) based on temperature programmed desorption (TPD). The D2 and Ne species tend to be incorporated in ASW without being caged, whereas two distinct peaks assignable to the caged species are identifiable for the other solutes examined here. The low-temperature peak is observed preferentially for Ar and CH4 prior to crystallization. The hydrophobes are thought to be encapsulated in porous ASW films via reorganization of the hydrogen bond network up to 100 K; most of them are released in a liquidlike phase that occurs immediately before crystallization at ca. 160 K. The nature of hydrophobic hydration at cryogenic temperature appears to differ from that in normal water at room temperature because the former resembles crystalline ices in the local hydrogen-bond structure rather than the latter. No ordered structures assignable to clathrate hydrates were identified before and after crystallization.},

In recent years, we have determined the self-continuum absorption of water vapour at different spectral points of the atmospheric windows at 4.0, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.25 μm, by highly sensitive cavity-enhanced laser techniques. These accurate experimental constraints have been used to adjust the last version (3.2) of the semi-empirical MT-CKD model (Mlawer-Tobin-Clough-Kneizys-Davies), which is widely incorporated in atmospheric radiative-transfer codes. In the present work, the self-continuum cross-sections, CS, are newly determined at 3.3 μm (3007 cm-1) and 2.0 μm (5000 cm-1) by optical-feedback-cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (OFCEAS) and cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS), respectively. These new data allow extending the spectral coverage of the 4.0 and 2.1 μm windows, respectively, and testing the recently released 3.2 version of the MT-CKD continuum. By considering high temperature literature data together with our data, the temperature dependence of the selfcontinuum is also obtained.},

   abstract = {Infrared spectra of the water clusters have been measured in the N 2 + O2 matrix. The aggregation process of water in the matrix has been monitored by annealing the deposited samples up to 40 K and UV irradiation. The monomer, dimer, cyclic trimer and cyclic pentamer are found as water clusters in the matrix. For the hexamer, several structures such as chair, cage, prism, bag 1 and/or book 1 are likely to exist. By UV irradiation, the cyclic pentamer is predominantly formed from the monomer and dimer. On the other hand, by annealing the deposited sample, several hexamers are formed. The theoretical calculation for water clusters has revealed that the formation of one hydrogen bonding in a hydrogen-bonded chain cooperatively enhances or diminishes the strength of another hydrogen bond. Both proton donor (D) and acceptor (A) participating in a hydrogen-bonding pair DA are capable of forming hydrogen bonding with the other water molecules; D can additionally accept two protons and donate one proton, and A can additionally donate two protons and accept one proton. We have proposed the classification of hydrogen-bonding patterns considering the cooperativity, denoting as d′a′DAd″ a″, where d and a are integers indicating the number of proton donors and acceptors to D (the single prime) and A (the double prime), respectively. Then, a magnitude given by MOH = -d′ + a′ + d″ -a″ has been introduced, which is very useful for connecting the hydrogen-bonding patterns to their OH wavenumbers. As a result, it is revealed that the OH stretching bands of water clusters are characterized by eight indicators (free and MOH = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). The classification proposed here is applicable to the OH band analysis for the hydrogen-bonded water and alcohols in a condensed phase. © The Owner Societies 2005.},

   abstract = {We calculate theoretical IR and Raman line shapes for the OH stretch region of liquid water, using mixed quantum/classical and electronic-structure/ molecular-dynamics methods. Our approach improves upon the time-averaging approximation used earlier for the same problem, and our results are in excellent agreement with experiment. Previous analysis of theoretical results for this problem considered the extent of delocalization (over local OH stretch excitations) of the instantaneous vibrational eigenstates. In this work we present a complementary analysis in the time-domain, by decomposing the appropriate response functions into diagonal and off-diagonal contributions (in the local mode basis). Our analysis indicates that all vibrational spectra show signatures of coherent vibrational energy transfer. This is manifest in different (IR, isotropic and depolarized Raman) experiments to different extents, because of the competition between coherent energy transfer and rotational disorder. © 2010 the Owner Societies.},

Phys. Chem. A 2002, 106, 11993]. It is found that the relation between the OH stretch frequency and the length of the hydrogen bond in which the OH is involved is characterized by considerable dispersion. This dispersion, which is in part related to the varying OHO angle of the hydrogen bond, precludes a one-to-one correspondence between the OH frequency and the hydrogen bond length. Further, it is found that the time scale currently interpreted in terms of a stochastic modulation by the surrounding solvent of a highly frictionally damped hydrogen bond system is largely governed by hydrogen bond-breaking and -making dynamics, while the motion of an intact hydrogen-bonded complex is underdamped in character. A detailed analysis of these issues is provided for calculated spectral dynamics after creation of a hole in the ground vibrational state, in terms of a three time analysis (in addition to the H-bond period). Further, the validity of describing the OH frequency fluctuations as a Gaussian random process is examined, as is the character of the associated autocorrelation function of the OH frequency shift.},

   abstract = {The theoretical study of off-resonant fifth-order two-dimensional (2D)-Raman spectroscopy is made to analyze the intermolecular dynamics of liquid and solid water. The 2D-Raman spectroscopy is susceptible to the nonlinear anharmonic dynamics and local hydrogen bond structure in water. It is found that the distinct 2D-Raman response appears as the negative signal near the t 2 axis. The origin of this negative signal for t2< 15 fs is from the nonlinear polarizability in the librational motions, whereas that for 30 fs< t2 < 150 fs is attributed to the anharmonic translational motions. It is found that the mechanical anharmonicity and nonlinear polarizability couplings among modes clearly can be observed as the sum- and difference-frequency peaks in the 2D-Raman spectrum (i.e., Fourier transforms of the response). The 2D-Raman spectroscopies of ice Ih and amorphous ices, i.e., low density, high density, and very high density amorphous ices, are also investigated. It is found that the 2D-Raman spectroscopy is very sensitive to the anisotropy of the structure of ice Ih. The strong hydrogen bond stretching band is seen in the 2D-Raman spectroscopy of the polarization directions parallel to the c axis, whereas the contributions of the librational motion can be also seen in the spectrum with the polarization directions parallel to the a axis. The 2D-Raman spectroscopy is also found to be also very sensitive to the differences in local hydrogen bond network structures in various amorphous phases. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {A new model is proposed for liquid water, based on recent studies of the Raman spectra as a function of temperature. It features two kinds of hydrogen bonds: in addition to the well known linear hydrogen bonds (LHB), predominant in cold water, there are some bifurcated hydrogen bonds (BHB) between three water molecules. These three-centered bonds, mainly electrostatic, have an average energy of 2.5 kcal mol-', about half of that of the LHB. Their characteristic 0-H stretching frequency is around 3420-3440 cm-', compared with 3220 cm-' for the LHB. In addition, there are a few percent of nearly free OH groups, i.e. non-hydrogen-bonded (NHB), with a stretching frequency of ca 3615 cm-'. Reorientation between these three states occurs through rotation of the H20 molecules about one of their 0-H bonds. Thus, on melting, one third of the hydrogen atoms move out of the tetrahedral framework to occupy interstitial sites in the open 'shafts' characteristic of the ice structure. As in the case of ice, Fermi resonance between the v1 and 2v, levels has little impact on the vibrational spectra of liquid water and ice. The hybrid molecule, HDO, does not form LHB with H 2 0 or D20, hence its simpler spectra. The BHB model can account much better than previous models for the thermodynamic anomalies of water.},
