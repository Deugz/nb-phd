# ASW_Data_Processing
This is a research compendium attempt to process empirical data related to amorphous solid water

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Deugz/ASW_Data_Processing/HEAD?labpath=Data_Analysis_Binder.ipynb)

## Helpfull ressources for me

- <a href="https://medium.com/linkit-intecs/how-to-upload-large-files-to-github-repository-2b1e03723d2" target="_blank">Upload large files to github</a>

## Things to do

- Handle the presence of Nan value in post name construction
- create a DR2/DR3 button within matplotlib window 

## Problems to solve

- Impossible to open DR2.zip on Binder --> Need to create a DR2 final version and host it on <a href="https://ordo.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> ORDO</a> (?) and subsequently call it within the notebook in a Post-build file.
