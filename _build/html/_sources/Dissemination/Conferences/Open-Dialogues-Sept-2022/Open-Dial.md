## Talk The effect of simple alcohol

**Author**: Jake E Fulker
***

Very intersting, go and get the talk !!

Do you codeposit or layer

methanol decrease water crystalisation temperature !!

Wendy Brown

***
## Talk IR photodesorption of CO from Amorphous Solid Water under astrophysically relevant conditions

**Author**: Emily Rose Ingman
***



Dust grain diagram - **Burke et al 2010**

Astrochemistry

***


***
## Talk X

**Author**: li Mingjie 
***

Lots of math but good presentation sills

***


## The Quantum Workforce

**Author**: Michael Fox  
***

Why the Quantum workforce ?

quantum technologies are becoming commercialised:
- ...
- ....

New challenges and opportunities
Governments want to be ahead of potential competitors

purpose is inform university how to develop their courses and how to support them

### Qualitative Research methodologies

nvivo software - codes ...

### Results

#### status of the quantum industry

Jobs:
- Engineer
- Experimental scientist
- Theorist
- Technician

## Talk 7 Jim

**Author**: Jim Hague  
***

### Motivation

Nature is full of paterns ... some indicate a role for physics

Tissues are made of cells and extracellualr matrix

Glial cells are elongated ->

cells attach to ECM via [integrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrin) proteins

#### What could we do if we understand the physics

- artificial tissues for clinical trials
- transplant ...
- artificial meat

### Tissue

- highly organised
...

Goal develop a microscopicmodel to predict the self-organisation of orientations and positions of a large number of cells.

**Force dipoles**

### Vasculature

## Talk 6 Naming conventions: Who is making an impact?

**Author**: Annie Lenox  
***

BepiColombo arrive in 2025

Why do we map:
- Build a geological history
- identify targets
- ...

- Nairne crater (poets)

**Shoutout:**
***


***
## Talk 5 scaffold ...,

**Author**: Christopher Brown   
***

Nanosheets and layered materials
cells material interactions

scaffolds to mimic tissues

Graphene oxide

**Shoutout:**
***


***
## Talk 4 Variations in hippocampal lipid ...,

**Author**: Hao Meng   
***

Biospec [biomedical spectroscopy lab Exeter](https://physics-astronomy.exeter.ac.uk/research/biomedical/research-interests/membrane-biophysics/) --> Super interesting for us !!

Alzheimer disease most common form of dementia (60 - 70%)

2 pathologies hallmark:
- amyloidopathy
- tauopathy

BBB -> Lipid metabolism between blood and brain


**Shoutout:**
***


## Talk 3 Interferometric observations of AGN ... How does it work,

**Author**: Nora Drewes   
***

Whta is AGN - supermassive Black hole actively accreting

Dust make (feedback) links between Black hole and his galaxy -> How ?

Polar Outflow cone -> Similar to PPD ? 

### Conclusion

no evidence of polar outflow cone


**Shoutouts**: Funky presentation ;)

***
## What accelerate the proton aurora in the Earth cusp,

**Author**: Rowan dayton  
***

### Intro

Solar wind, protons neutron w/ magnetic field (plasma)
- enter via poles (funnel) - protons are accelerated by ?
    - EMIC (form of plasma waves)

**Laundau damping** ?

Observations of aurora is great lab for studying plasma physics

HITIES


**Shoutouts**: Great drawing skills
***

***
## Quantum correlated probes for weak field sensing,

**Author**: Tim Leese
***

### Motivations

- Quantum computing
- Quantum sensing

-> discover new physics

what links the two - **Qbits** (2 level system)

### Requirements

- Cold atoms
- adress qubits
- atoms must be able to communicate

**Rydberg atoms** -> switch on/off using laser

CNOT gate ?

### Simulating Qbits

Alevel student

Would love to talk about but no time - Come and do it here !?

Good for Experimental predictions

### Magneto-Optical trap

### Dipole Trap

or Optical tweezers (move and control positions of atoms)
Atome is trap w/ dipole forces

**Shoutouts**: Great talk, very accessible way to chat about a complicated topic

## Finding my inner selfie,

**Author**: Yolanda Ohene
***

UCL master studie, only black people ...

- AFM (Atomic force microscope) -observe bacteria -> produce lipids ->use to produce biofuel

Had to choose betwenn academia and science communication -> Why not both ?

Post master -> **Media production companies**

then PhD - IRM images of brain (Manchester)

Postdoc (UCL)

Michele dougherty (tought electromagnetism) - inspiration for her, and for women in physics

### technique explanation

### Her work

- 2020: 850 000 people with dementia (1.6 M in 2040)

- BBB (blood brain barrier) breakdown 
    - pathogens and neurotoxins go into the brain
    - brain immune response
    - immune response of brain amyloid deposition
    - neuro degeneration
    
magnetic tracer and if is in the brain -> BBB breakdown

want to use water **instead**

- How ?

    - Water is marked ? -> How ?

- Arterial Spin Labelling MRI
Use water as a tracer.

- Filtering imaging technique

### What sucks in doing research

gut imaging

How does the gut leads to the brain

Broken pipeline (leaking pipeline)

22 000 UK professors (1% black)

Created a community Minorities in Stem -> [Web-site](https://minoritiesinstem.wordpress.com/)

- Dr Mark Richards - Blackettlabfam Network

"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house" - Audrey Lorde 

[comments web-site](https://www.menti.com/)

### The heart

- Outreach and science communication

Young have lots of great ideas and help you simplify your work

- What is the message
- Be inclusive
- include interactive elements
- Avoid using only the deficit model
- Representation counts

## Summary 

What makes you you:
- Brain: inquisitive mind
- Strong gut
- Open Heart

**Shoutouts**:
- Incredibly inspirational, thank you :) 
- Very laidback presentation and great presentation skills.
Overall, amazing

### Most important frontier in physics and why ?

...

Artificial intelligence and machine learning -> Trendy
