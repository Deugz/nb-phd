## EM Spectrum

### Infrared absorbtion

Identify functional groups within molecules. 

We used a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR spectrometer combined with an external mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector to aquire our IR spectrum.

spectrum = Intensity (y axis) vs Wavenumber (x axis)

- red-shift  -> <strong>Bathochromic</strong> shift (shift to longer wavelength)
- blue-shift -> <strong>Hypsochromic</strong> shift (shift to shorter wavelength)

### Ice growth and thickness measurments

The ice films are grown by physical vapour deposition (pure or mixed). 

- prior to deposition background is aquired

#### Monitoring the growth

Monocromatic light (HeNe laser with wavelength &lambda; = 638 nm) is
