### 17/01/2023

- Open the code in Jupyter Lab 
- Try to run and solve problems when they arise (note them down below)

#### Sample Overview

- Work on the sample Folder architecture 
    - Split into Data-RAW and Data-Processing &#9989;
    - Split into XP-1_1 and XP-1_2 (is it usefull really ?) - may be an extra complication when we want to compare samples between different experiments.

- Check that no sample is missing and that the numbers of scans is correct

**Result**


#### DR0

- **Purpose**: The purpose is to manually implement the temperature ramp of each sample into a single csv containing all the samples: <span style="color:green;">XP_list_test.csv</span>

```{note}

Can I find this csv somewhere - &#9989;
- Is it complete (does he have all the samples) - &#10060;
    - 14 samples missing - to add 



```
