## Introduction

## Purity

ie purely amorphous, no <strong>crystaline nuclei</strong>

## Density

### Hydrogen bonding

{cite:p}`Parmentier2015` 

"H-atom dynamics in several forms of ASW, inelastic neutron scattering, mean kinetic energies increase with increasing density (weaker H-bonds) vibrational potential energy surfaces get steeper, change in O-H stretching component with density stronger than suggested by e.g. Raman spectroscopy"

## Porosity

***
- {cite:p}`Manca2002`: Porosity & SSA of ASW & crystalline ice, N2, CH4 and Ar adsorption, adsorption isotherm volumetry & infrared spectroscopy, non-microporous ice can have large SSA
***

### What pores ?

```{note}

Insert Sabrina article on pore shape

```


Insert sabrina article

{cite:p}`Mate2012b`


### Evolution with temperature




#### Experimental

##### IR 

- {cite:p}`Isokoski2014`: Compaction of ice (H2O, CH3OH, CO2, mixed H2O:CO2 = 2:1) upon heating, astronomically relevant T-range, Laser interference & FTIR, for ASW the full loss of dangling OH bonds is not a proof for full compaction, for other ices thermal segregation benefits from higher degree of porosity.

- {cite:p}`Bossa2012`: ASW pore collapse, 20 -120 K, thickness (optical interference) & porosity/phase (FTIR) measurements, porous ASW: thickness decreases by (12 ± 1) % between 20 and 120 K, less porous ASW: smaller thickness decrease, crystalline ice: negligible thickness decrease.

#### Simulations


{cite:p}`Cazaux2015`


### Consequences 

#### Trapping of molecules

```{warning}

**Big topic** !!

- Find intellegent method of classification ... Per molecule studied ?

```

```{note}

Link with ethane deposition type
- sequential
- co-deposition

```


##### CO<sub>2</sub>

- {cite:p}`Galvez2008`: SSA of ASW: Spectroscopy on CO2 ice (trapped in ASW pores), deposition at 95 K (simultaneously or sequentially), CO2 infrared bands shift & split in both cases (interaction with water molecules), larger amount of CO2 trapped in ASW in co-deposition, in sequential deposition most CO2 trapped in macropores of ASW, phase transition at 140 K -> CO2 molecules relocate -> similar bulk structure to co-deposited samples 

- {cite:p}`Malyk2007`: Trapping and release of 13CO2 by porous ASW (13CO2 on top of/below/codeposited with ASW), TPD & FTIR, some 13CO2 becomes trapped when annealing ASW (amount depends on deposition method), two stage release of trapped 13CO2: 1. majority escapes at ASW-to-cubic transition (165 K), 2. rest desorbs together with cubic ice (185 K) -> must be trapped in cavities that do not open during crystallisation.  


##### CH<sub>4</sub>

- {cite:p}`Raut2007`: Porosity of ASW via quartz crystal microgravimetry, UV-visible interferometry, and infrared reflectance spectrometry in tandem with methane adsorption: microporosity for all deposition methods, but collimated depositions show additional mesoporosity (up to 140 K (crystallization)), higher binding energy for collimated deposition, methane on dangling OH bonds -> no multilayer condensation inside micropores (methane coating the walls instead of filling the pore volume).

#### Cracking

{cite:p}`Bu2016`




### Specific Surface Area 

- **SSA** (Definition).


## Diffusivity

<p class="emphase"> Molecular diffusion occurs as a result of thermal motion of the molecules.</p>

{cite:p}`Smith2000`


### Models of diffusion

{cite:p}`Ghesquiere2015`

## Desorption

{cite:p}`Speedy1996`: Free energy difference (ΔiaG (150 K) = 1100 J/mol) & residual entropy difference (ΔiaS (0) = 0.7 J/(K mol)) for ASW & crystalline ice, from evaporation rates, ΔiaS (0) allows connection of ASW with normal liquid H2O via reversible thermodynamic path (1 atm).

***

Thermal desorption formula (test)

$$
k_{td,i} \simeq  \nu _{i} e ^{-\frac{E_{b,i}}{k_{B} T_{S}}}
$$



## Polarization

{cite:p}`Bu2015`: Surface voltages (Vs) of ASW (vapour deposited below 110 K), **Kelvin probe measurements**, Vs increases with film thickness & decreases with deposition T & angle, decreases by ≈ 80 % when annealed 30 K above deposition T, -> **polarization in ASW is governed by incompletely coordinated water molecules**, dangling with unbalanced dipoles at internal surface of pores

```{note}

Hence the importanceof characterising the HB network in ASW

```

## Structural relaxation

{cite:p}`Shephard2013`: LDA (prepared from HDA or vapour deposited) annealing, Raman & FTIR spectroscopy, structural relaxation -> increase of local and long-range order (starting before crystallisation and not finished at onset of crystallisation) -> contradicting findings on glass transition.


### 2 distinct structural state ?

Neutron diffraction: {cite:p}`Winkel2009`: Neutron diffraction on low density amorphous ice (produce from high density ASW by isobaric warming or very high density ASW by isothermal compression), -> two different forms of LDA (different compression behaviour & structures (atomistic modelling -> competition between short & intermediate order & disorder)).  


## Structure

### Structure factor

```{note}

To define (R<sub>OO</sub>)

```


{cite:p}`Barker2000` oxygen-oxygen structure factor SOO(Q) peak of liquid water shows unusual doublet structure (shifting with pressure), limits correspond to peak positions of low/high density ASW -> polyamorphism of H2O, position determined by nearest-neighbour separation of voids in spatial distribution of oxygen atoms


### Variation w/ experimental conditions

#### Deposition angle

- {cite:p}`Dohnalek2003`: ASW characterisation (laser optical interferometry): film thickness & density of ASW films (vapour deposited @ 22 K, collimated molecular beam, angle varied between normal & oblique incidence), normal incidence films presumed to be compact (0.94 g/cm3), glancing incidence ρ = 0.16 g/cm3 (> 80 % porosity), in agreement with ballistic deposition simulations.

{cite:p}`Stevenson1999`


#### Surface

{cite:p}`Mate2003`: ASW & crystalline H2O ice (vapour deposited), < 100 nm – 5 μm thickness, FT-RAIRS, Al & Au substrates (similar results for both), optical effects (surface suppression/vibrational mode enhancement) vary with thickness, spectral simulations (**Fresnel model**)




## Phase transition between polyamorphs

Occur in a very narrow temperature-pressure interval (more info) and is characterized by sudden, step-like changes in properties such as:

- Density
- Coordination number
- Isothermal compressibility

Furthermore, tha transitions can be reversed with **hysteresis**, (typical from first order transition)

```{note}

define the different type of transitions.
