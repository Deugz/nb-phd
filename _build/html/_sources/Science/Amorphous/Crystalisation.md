## ASW Crystalisation ...

<p class="emphase2">From an Astrochemist point of view</p>


<p class="emphase">ASW crystalisation is often described as a single event occuring throughout the whole sample</p>

Even though that may be correct within certain laboratory condition, particulary those using high rate of annealing like for example DSC, the picture is probably much more complex than that

## Crystalisation Proceses

### Nucleation

#### Homogeneous

##### Thickness dependence

{cite:p}`Harada2020`


#### Heterogeneous


### Growth


{cite:p}`Yuan2017`

### Models 



Decoupling of simultaneous nucleation and growth processes as well as the quantification of their kinetics {cite:p}`Safarik2003b`. Growth is isolated from nucleation by dividing a phase transition into two isothermal stages:
- <strong>prenucleation</strong>, where product crystallites nucleate and grow concurrently 
- <strong>growth</strong>, in which transformation is completed essentially entirely by the expansion of these *seed* grains


Isothermal transformation kinetics can usually be described by the <strong>Kolmogorov–Johnson–Mehl–Avrami</strong> equation:

## Crystalisation kinetics of ASW 

<p class="emphase">The overall kinetics of an isothermal phase transition is usually determined by the time dependence of a specimen’s converted  fraction,  which  is  often determined using calorimetry, spectroscopy, or diffraction</p>



Studies that state that ASW crystalises from the surface:
