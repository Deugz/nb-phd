While most people are familiar with the crystalline structure of ice, there is another form of ice that is less well-known: <strong>Amorphous Solid Water </strong> (ASW). In this section, we will explore in depth what amorphous solid water is, how it has been discovered, how it is formed and its significance in various fields of study.

## Discovery  

<p class="emphase"> Amorphous solid water, is a form of ice that lacks a crystalline structure. It is also referred to as non-crystalline, glassy, or vitreous ice. Unlike crystalline ice, which has a well-defined periodic arrangement of molecules, ASW is disordered and lacks long-range order (similar to glass)</p>

The first experimental description of amorphous water ice has been achieved in 1935 by {cite:p}`Burton1935` that deposited water vapor on a copper rod maintained at -155 &#x2103; It has since been an intense subject of research involving multiple production method and characterisation techniques.

Optical constants - necessary to produce "artificial" spectra necessary to fit observation.
Experimental spectra can also be directly feated to observation cf Alexis work.

#### Scattering Experiments

XRay/ Neutron

Best technique to obtain information on crystal structure. Costly and lots of other constraints.

- {cite:p}`Essmann1995`: Molecular dynamics simulation, vapour deposited ASW, compared to neutron scattering data from high & low density ASW (pressure induced transformation of crystalline ice), result: vapour deposited ASW between the other two, but closer to high density ASW, agreement with vapour deposited ASW neutron scattering & electron diffraction studies, ASW surface layer deeply fissured (-> high porosity of vapour deposited ice).

```

{cite:p}`Narten1976` showed that different deposition temperatures using the same vapor deposition setup and methodology would lead to two different forms of amorphous ice, where those differences are inferred from diffraction data (both Neutron and X-Ray):

::::{grid} 2
:::{grid-item-card}

Ice deposited at 77K is **low density**

^^^

- Diffraction pattern consistent with a structure that has oxygen-oxygen nearest-neighbor tetrahedral symmetry on average, and a  nearest neighbor 0-0 separation of 2.76 &#8491 with **small dispersion**; -> *What is meant by this ?*
- Density estimated 0.94 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>

:::
:::{grid-item-card}
Ice deposited at 10K is **high density**
^^^

- Diffraction pattern similar to, yet distinctively different from, that of the high temperature deposit. The 0-0 nearest neighbor distance is the same. 2.76 &#8491 but the **dispersion in this separation is larger in the low temperature form**.
- Diffraction pattern shows an extra peak at 3.3 &#8491. corresponding to about 1.4 molecules. the existence of which is responsible for the **estimated** higher density, namely 1.1 g.cm<sup>-3</sup>
    
:::
::::

```{admonition} Question

How is the density determined from Diffraction data

```


When subject to increasing pressure, amorphous ice **soften (what is meant by this ?)** and then suddenly collapse to a denser but still amorphous phase. This result is verified by computer simulations where density and structure of the high density amorphous form depends on the **potential function** chosen to represent the water.
- to verify (ref 5 - 7) simulation 8-9

Despite the non-crytalline nature of the molecular arrangements in LDA, both the thermodynamic state and
the vibrational characteristics are those of a highly ordered substance.  The **heat carrying phonons** of low temperature amorphous water behave like those in a crystal.
- What does this mean, where does it come from ?
Similar (but less dramatic) behaviour have been observed in other tetrahedrally coordinated solid (SiO2, GeO2, ZNCl2 etc). 


### ASW

Vapor deposition methods were employed to prepare ASW for the following studies:

- Calorimetry

- Spectroscopy

- vapor pressure and free energy

- **Crystalisation** 33,35,34,36 
    - {cite:p}`Jenniskens1996`
    - {cite:p}`Safarik2003` - Thickness dependance, Investigated by TPD
    - model : 78 - 79

- Dielectric relaxation

- Neutron and X-ray diffraction structure studies

- diffusion studies

- electron microscope

- vibrational dynamics studies (by neutron scattering)

- Thermal conductivity studies

The sharp crystallization exotherm commencing in the range of 150–160 K during reheating is the one universal feature of all previous studies of ASW or vitreous water.

#### Other preparation techniques

- cold microtoming method (68)

- decompression amorphization (73)

- electron bombardment vitrification (67, 76, 76a) - could be compatible with accoustic levitation

- radiation damage–induced vitrification (77)

-  phase-separation vitrification (12)

- plunge freeze (67)

Heat capacity increase is also a main varying parameter obeserved during glass transition (Tg)

## Structure 

### Amorphous vs Crystaline Ice

How does amorphous ices differs from its crystaline conterpart ? Well it depends on the formation route
of the amorphous ice.

### Morphology

- {cite:p}`Stevenson1999`



#### Influence of the Substrate

- {cite:p}`Smith1996`
    - **desorption kinetics** are substrate dependent and suggest strongly that the film morphology is governed by the   hydrophilicity of the substrate.
    - **crystallization kinetics** are independent of substrate but depend strongly on both temperature and film thickness and are consistent with a *spatially random nucleation and isotropic growth model*.
    
- {cite:p}`Dohnalek2000`
    - dramatic acceleration of the crystallization rate is observed for amorphous films on crystalline ice substrates
    - crystallization-induced cracking of the films

### Atmospheric Science 

ASW plays an important role in atmospheric processes, such as cloud formation and ice nucleation. Clouds are formed when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses onto tiny particles, such as dust or pollen, forming droplets. In certain conditions, such as at high altitudes, these droplets can freeze and form ice crystals. The presence of ASW can affect the freezing point of water, which can have significant implications for cloud formation and atmospheric processes.
