## Introduction




- **Review**: {cite:p}`Baragiola2003`


## Formation

### Adsorption

{cite:p}`Zhao2020`


### Simulation 

- {cite:p}`Garrod2013`: Monte Carlo kinetics model (using grain surface atom locations rather than fixed lattice structure), H & O atoms accrete onto grain to produce H2O, H2, O2, H2O2, porosity depends on gas density (2 × 104 cm−3 (dark interstellar clouds) produces fairly smooth & non-porous ice mantle), H2 formed collets in micropores, larger pores not filled with H2, direct deposition of water molecules onto grain indicates that amorphous ices formed this way may be significantly more porous than interstellar ices formed by surface chemistry.

***

- {cite:p}`Cuppen2007`: Simulations (continuous-time random-walk Monte Carlo), production rate & morphology of water dominated ice mantles containing CO & CO2, result: ice mantles only grow in denser regions.

```{note}

- Have a look for nice (tetris like images)

- Seems like there is H2 frozen on the grain (I thought that h2 desorbed after being produced ? -> to investigate)

How dense ? Compare w/ Garrod above
