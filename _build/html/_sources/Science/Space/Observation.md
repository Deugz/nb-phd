## Introduction

::::{margin}

```{note}

Go quick into observations of molecules and link to Astrochemistry chapter

- Focus on the observation techniques (and water!)


```

::::

Many molecules have been detected into the ISM

- cf list from cologne database 

All of those molecules have been detected in the gas phase via their ** rotational or electronic transitions**.

A few of them have been detected in the solid phase in the form of ices via their **vibrational modes**.

- COMS: Complex Organic Molecules are molecules with six or more atoms.

Large molecules are difficult to observe in spacetf
