## Because I can 

### Research Degree Regulations

#### Thesis

```{epigraph}

A PhD, MPhil or Professional Doctorate OU dissertation is normally a <span class="hovertext" data-hover="Definition">monograph</span>, that is, a single, coherent narrative that articulates the thesis and the evidence that supports it. Any additional elements (e.g., non-book components) must be properly integrated into the narrative to provide a coherent and comprehensive whole. The dissertation must satisfy OU standards of presentation and the QAA research degree characteristics (Appendix 1 of the Research Degree Regulations)

-- Thesis Submission Guidelines, Research Degrees, The Open University
```

- Appendix 1 research degree regulations

- search for, discover, access, retrieve, sift, interpret, analyse, evaluate, manage, conserve and communicate an ever-increasing volume of knowledge from a range of sources;

- think critically about problems to produce innovative solutions and create new knowledge;

- plan, manage and deliver projects, selecting and justifying appropriate methodological processes while recognising, evaluating and minimising the risks involved and impact on the environment;

- exercise professional standards in research and research integrity, and engage in professional practice, including ethical, legal, and health and safety aspects, bringing enthusiasm, perseverance and integrity to bear on their work activities;

- support, collaborate with and lead colleagues, using a range of teaching, communication and networking skills to influence practice and policy in diverse environments;

- appreciate the need to engage in research with impact and to be able to communicate it to diverse audiences, including the public;

- build relationships with peers, senior colleagues, students and stakeholders with sensitivity to equality, diversity and cultural issues.

#### Book / Non-Book Component

I have not found any precision about what is meant by bookin the *Research Degree Regulations*, hence I went to look for a definition in the Oxford dictionary where it is said that:

<p class="emphase">A <strong>book</strong> is a written work published in printed or <strong>electronic</strong> form</p>

As a result I think I should be allowed to publish a thesis that is 100% online

It is stipulated that a non-book component can be included 

#### Physical copie


```{epigraph}

You will need to submit an electronic copy of your thesis at submission. The electronic copy should be submitted in PDF format to the Research Degrees Team through PGR Manager https://doctoral-research-system.open.ac.uk/. 

-- Thesis Submission Guidelines, Research Degrees, The Open University

```

OK a pdf copy will be submitted but the whole thesis (ie web-format) should be used for assesment as it is more important than the book component.

## The Need

### Improve note taking capabilities

Implement here Manifesto grid

### PhD Deliverable

#### Web-site Architecture

There is a need for the scientific community to overcome it's relience on commercial publication. Lots of tools and guidances have been developped over the past few years, like the excellent *Turing way* {cite:p}`Community2022`, to help researcher find their way into Open Science. It is time to put those practices in operation and that is the aim of this online thesis which is a

^^^
    
I think research is gangrened by the commercial scientific publication system and an alternative to that is <strong>self-publication</strong> (cf Manifesto). 

<h4><strong>The Open University</strong></h4>    
    
The Open University (OU) is a values-led institution which seeks to be *“Open to people, places, methods and ideas”*. It also says to champions openly shared, engaged research of all kinds alongside its world-leading approach to online teaching ([Source](https://www.open.ac.uk/research/support-researchers/open-university-statement-responsible-use-research-metrics)).

<h4><strong>The scientific community</strong></h4>    
    
Open Research, more collaboration and less relience on the commercial scientific publication system

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>1 tool </u></strong></h3>   
^^^  
<h4><strong>Jupyter Book</strong></h4>

Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material. 
- Easy 
- Interactive
- ...
In summary much better than writing pdfs with latex.

<h5><strong>Paper Version</strong></h5>

Jupyter Book allow the generation of 2 types of output, html (here) and pdf (there)    
    
```{warning}
A paper version is to be produced and can be made accessible upon request.

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Create a dialogue ...</u></strong></h3>
    
I aim to deliver the scientific knowledge that I produced using a **conversational tone**. I think it can help attracting a much wider audience without doing any harm to the scientific content itself. A website offer a limitless set of tools to achieve that goal.  

<h4> <strong>... with all kind of audiences</strong> </h4>

## Why Not

### More Outputs 

#### School 2.A

- We learn best when we teach what we learn.

- We learn best not from experts, but from someone who's only one step ahead.
