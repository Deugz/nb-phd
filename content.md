There is a need for the scientific community to overcome it's relience on commercial publication. Lots of tools and guidances have been developped over the past few years, like the excellent *Turing way* {cite:p}`Community2022`, to help researcher find their way into Open Science. It is time to put those practices in operation and that is the aim of this online thesis which is a

I think research is gangrened by the commercial scientific publication system and an alternative to that is <strong>self-publication</strong> (cf Manifesto). 

<h4><strong>The Open University</strong></h4>    
    
The Open University (OU) is a values-led institution which seeks to be *“Open to people, places, methods and ideas”*. It also says to champions openly shared, engaged research of all kinds alongside its world-leading approach to online teaching ([Source](https://www.open.ac.uk/research/support-researchers/open-university-statement-responsible-use-research-metrics)).

<h4><strong>The scientific community</strong></h4>    
    
Open Research, more collaboration and less relience on the commercial scientific publication system

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>1 tool </u></strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Jupyter Book</strong></h4>

Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material. 
- Easy 
- Interactive
- ...
In summary much better than writing pdfs with latex.

<h3><strong>&#187;  <u>Create a dialogue ...</u></strong></h3>
    
I aim to deliver the scientific knowledge that I produced using a **conversational tone**. I think it can help attracting a much wider audience without doing any harm to the scientific content itself. A website offer a limitless set of tools to achieve that goal.  

<h4> <strong>... with all kind of audiences</strong> </h4>

This web-site is an experiment aimed at <strong>communicating research </strong>. Communication involve an audience, and there is a whole diapora of possible audiences for this project: 
In order to communicate, I will leave notes (4 types, cf below) here and there, sometimes with a tag refering to the audience they are adressed to. Feel free to comment them (like I did) using Hypothesis button (<strong>top right corner</strong>)
