## Introduction

This web-site is a <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html" target="blank"> Research compendium </a> produced using <a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html" target="blank"> Jupyter-Book</a>. This book is part of the **Science For the People** project whose aim is to empower researcher to self-publish themselves in an open and innovative way, far from the unsustainable current publication system. This Book focus on my PhD project, whose title is:

<p class="emphase">Experimenting with the earliest stages of planet formation</p>

If you are eager to know more about the Science and How this book is organised, go visit the [Science](Science/Science.md) page. Using this plateform during my PhD (actually more towards the end) as proven incredibly usefull and because I aim to help others used this method, let me tell you a few benefits of using JupyterBook during your research journey.

### Benefits  

For me, as a Researcher, this web-site is a tool to help me:

**Comments** <br>

I intend to use two different commenting systems (for different purposes)

On the right corner are `hypothesis` (Link) buttons allowing **commenting of the whole book**, like you would do in Word.
- Transparent **Peer-Review** process
